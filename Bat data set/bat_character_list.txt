Phenotypic characters (numbered in Nexus format)



Array characters
  
1. Upper incisors direction of projection of tooth shaft [[From Giannini and Simmons (2005: character 57).  This is measured relative to a vertical line through the middle of the root of the incisor where it emerges from the alveolus.  Best seen in lateral view.  In the orthodont condition, the crown shaft of incisor lies directly on the line (so the tooth appears directed straight vertially).  In the proodont condition, the crown shaft of the incisor lies anterior to the line (so the tooth appears to be procumbent and project anteriorly).  This character can be scored when only one upper incisor is present since it is uniform across the incisor dentition (as far as we know).]] orthodont (0); proodont (1).
  

2. Upper incisors orientation of tip of crown [[From Giannnini and Simmons (2005: character 61).  Orthoclivous = tips directed in the same direction as the long axis of the shaft of the tooth; retroclivous = tips directed posteriorly, at an angle to the long axis of the shaft of the tooth.  In the retroclivous condition, the tip apprear slightly recurved.  This varies independently of the orientation of the tooth shaft (see preceeding character).   This character can be scored when only one upper incisor is present since it is uniform across the incisor dentition (as far as we know).]] orthoclivous (0); retroclivous (1).
  

3. Upper I1 presence [[Modified from Simmons and Geisler (1998: character 16).]] I1 present (0); absent (1).

5. Upper I1 shape of occlusal margin [[Modified from Wetterer et al. (200: character 50); Simmons and Conway (2001: character 29).  Describes the shape of the occlusal margin (cutting edge of the tooth) as seen in labial view.  Unordered.]] large main cusp that tapers to a blunt point (additional lateral cusp may be present) (0); straight or slighlty convex and rounded (1); bilobed (2); blade-like with concave C-shaped cutting edge (3).

8. Upper I1 position of pointed main cusp [[From Wetterer et al. (2000: character 51).  Refers to the position of the main cusp relative to the central axis of the tooth (axis through root shaft and crown).  Can be scored only in taxa with a pointed main cusp on I1.  Ordered.]] main cusp offset mesially from axis of tooth (0); main cusp in center of tooth (so tooth crown is roughly bilaterally symmetrical) (1); main cusp offset distally from axis of tooth (2).
  

9. Upper I1 distal accessory cusp [[ ]] absent (0); present (1).
  

10. Upper I1 relative size of pointed mesial cusp [[From Wetterer et al. (2000: character 52).

11. Upper I1 lingual cingulum presence [[Modified from Simmons and Conway (2001: character 31).  Treated separately from a similar characer for I2 because distribution varies in some taxa (e.g., Myotis lucifugus has a cingulum on I2 but not I1).  Should not be scored in taxa where the crown of the tooth is not differentiated from the root shaft.]] absent (0); present (1).
  

12. Upper I1 occlusion [[From Wetterer et al. (200: character 55).  Unordered.]] I1 in contact with i1 or separated by a small gap when cheek teeth are in occlusion (0); I1 separated from i1 by a large gap when cheek teeth are in occlusion (1); I1 occludes with mesial side of i2 (2); I1 occludes with anterior cingulum of lower canine. (3); I1 occludes with cingular shelf on lower canine, well posterior to i1 (4); I1 occludes posterior to i1 in mandibular fossa (5).
  

13. Upper incisors relative crown height [[Modified from Wetterer et al. (2000:  character 49), Simmons and Conway (2001: character 30).  Describes the relative crown height of the two incisors when seen in labial view, as measured from the base of the tooth to the tip of the highest cusp.

Ordered.]] height of I1 less than height of I2 (0); I1 and I2 subequal in height (1); height of I1 greater than height of I2 but less than twice the height of I2 (2); height of I1 at least twice that of I2 (3).
  

14. Upper I2 occlusal exposure [[Modified from Simmons (1996: character 20).  It is possible that this character should be scored only in taxa that have I2 shorter than I1 since exclusion from the occlusal row may be related to reduction in size of I2.  Simmons (1996) included reduction or loss of I2 as part of state 1 of this character, but we treat those conditions in separate characters.  This character can be scored only in taxa that have both I1 and I2 present.]] I2 in normal position between I1 and C, not excluded from occlusion toothrow (0); I2 moved dorsally and excluded from occlusal toothrow by close apposition of I1 and C (1); I2 moved ventrally and excluded from occlusal toothrow by close apposition of I1 and C (2).
  

15. Upper I2 presence [[From Simmons and Geisler (1998: character 16); Wetterer et al. (2000: character 48); Simmons and Conway (2001: character 28); Simmons and Giannini (2005: character 59).]] I2 present (0); absent (1).
  

16. Upper I1 and I2 relative position [[In state 0 the incisor arcade may be either u- or v-shaped when there is no gap between right and left incisors.

18. Upper I2 lingual cingulum presence [[From Giannini and Simmons (2005: character 60).  This character needs clarification; see differences between Onychonycteris and Pteronotus.  Originally referred to as a "posterobasal" cingulum but here termed a lingual cingulum.  Taxa scored as having a "simplified" I2 crown in the preceding character should be scored as inapplicable for this one.]] absent (0); cingulum present (1).
  

19. Upper I2 and C diastema presence [[Simmons and Conway (2001: character 32).  Cannot be scored in taxa lacking I2.  The lower canine fits into the space created by this diastema in at least some taxa (e.g., Onychonycteris).  This character should be scored as inapplicable in taxa lacking I2.]] diastema present (0); diastema absent between I2 and C, teeth in contact (1).

24. Upper C anteromedial groove [[From Giannini and Simmons (2005: character 65).  Probably should be called an "anterior or mesial" groove.]] groove absent (0); anteromedial groove present (1).

31. Upper C distal cingulum [[Based on Gunnell et al. (2008: pg. 5). Sometimes called the "posterior cingulum."

Ordered.]] absent (0); cingulum small (1); large (2).
  

32. Upper C posteromedial ridge [[From Giannini and Simmons (2005: character 66).  Ordered.]] ridge absent (0); posteromedial ridge present (1); two posteromedial ridges present forming a groove (2).

39. Upper C angle of projection [[Based on Storch et al. (2002: pg. 194).  Documenting this character normally requires a lateral view of the skull showing both the canine and the molar toothrow in labial view, although it may also be scored (with care) in fossils that can be examined only in occlusal view.]] does not project anteriorly; long axis of tooth shaft is perpendicular to plane of occlusal surface of molar toothrow (0); projects anteriorly; long axis of tooth shaft forms an oblique angle with the plane of the occlusal surface of the molar toothrow (1).

(2002: pg. 191).  Ordered.  This tooth is sometimes identified as P2 in taxa with 3 premolars (e.g., Storch et al., 2002).

43. Upper P1 position [[Based on Hand and Kirsch (1998: character 43).  They called this tooth P2; it is the anteriormost premolar in taxa with 2 premolars, which may be either P1 or P4 following our terminology (although the homologies of teeth need to be assessed individually for all taxa with only two upper premolars).  Ordered. Taxa with partial extrusion (states 1 and 3) should be checked to make sure that they are scored correctly.]] P1 labially extruded from toothrow, P5 directly contacts tooth anterior to it (usually C) while P1 is located labial to this contact (0); P1 partially extruded from toothrow on labial side but still partially separates teeth anterior and posterior to it.

47. Upper P4 position [[Based on Hand and Kirsch (1998: character 43).  They called this tooth P2; it is the anteriormost premolar in taxa with 2 premolars, which is P4 following our terminology (although the homologies of teeth need to be assessed individually for all taxa with only two upper premolars).

48. Upper P4 labial cingulum development [[Based on Storch et al. (2002: pg. 196).  States need to be better defined. Split into two characters since cingulum development may vary on P4 and P5 (e.g., Pteronotus).  Ordered.]] labial cingulum well developed (0); weakly developed (1); absent (2).

64. Upper P5 postparacrista extent [[Based on Storch et al. (2002: pg. 195).  Sometimes called a "posterolabial wing."

68. Upper P5 and M1/M2 alignment [[Modified from Giannini and Simmons (2005: character 74).  Ordered.

Ordered.]] strongly developed (0); present but weak (1); absent (2).
  

71. Upper molars pericone presence [[Based on Hand et al. (1994: 379).  The pericone is a cusp mesial to the protocone on the lingual aspect of the tooth.  Apparently present in Wyonycteris but absent in archaic bats (Hand et al., 1994).]] absent (0); pericone present (1).

74. Upper M1 and M2 stylar shelf presence [[Modified from Wetterer et al. (2000: character 60); Hand et al. (1994: pgs. 378-379).  Those authors described this feature as "presence of a W-shaped ectoloph" but we prefer to characterize it as presence of a stylar shelf, which must be present for a W-shaped ectoloph to exist.  Treating this feature this way prevents overlap with other characters describing presence/absence of the various cristae that comprise a W-shaped ectoloph (preparacrista, postparacrista, premetacrista, postmetacrista), not all of which are present in some taxa. ]] stylar shelf present on M1 and M2 (0); absent (1).

81. Upper M1 and M2 postparacrista and premetacrisita contact [[Based on Gunnell et al. (2008: pg. 3).  When the postparacrista and premetacrista are in contact on the labial edge of the tooth, this contact serves to close the trigon basin (= protofossa) labailly.  When these crista do not contact one another, the trigon basin/protofossa is open labially.]] postparactista contacts premetacrista on labial aspect of tooth, trigon closed labially (0); postparacrista does not contact premetacrista, trigon open labially (1).

It does not refer to the cleft between the paraone, metacone, and mesostyle (or the equivalent).]] wide and shallow (0); narrow and deep (1).
  

83. Upper M1 and M2 mesostyle presence and location [[Based on Gunnell et al. (2008: pg. 3).  When state 0 of this character is combined with absence of a contact between the postparacrista and premetacrista (as in Philisids) the condition conforms to what Sige (1985) called the "mesostyle dedouble."  Unordered.]] mesostyle absent (0); mesostyle formed at labial terminus of postparacrista (1); mesostyle formed at point of contact of postparacrista and premetacrista (2); mesostyle formed at labial terminus of premetacrista (3).
  

84. Upper M1 and M2 mesostyle size and labial extent [[Based on Gunnell et al. (2008: pg. 6).  Needs to be quantified somehow, perhaps combined in some way with other mesostyle characters.

85. Upper M1 and M2 lingual displacement of contact between postparacrista and premetacrista  [[Based on Hand (1996: Figure 3).  Score as inapplicable in taxa where these crests do not contact one another. The differences between states 1 and 2 need to be better described.  Ordered.]] not lingually displaced, lies in line with parastyle and metastyle (0); somewhat lingually displaced (1); strongly lingually displaced (2).

211. Lower molars trigonid fovea [[Based on Gunnell et al. (2008: pg. 8).  This character scores for whether or not the trigonid basin is closed or open lingually.  When the trigonid fovea is "closed" the paraconid and metaconid are either close together or connected by a crest lingually.  When the trigonid fovea is "open" there is a distinct valley developed between paraconid and metaconid so the trigonid fovea drains lingually.]] trigonid fovea closed (0); trigonid fovea open lingually (1).

In the nyctalodont condition, a well-developed cristid (usually called the postcristid) connects the hypoconid with the hypoconuild; this cristid forms the distal border of the talonid.  In contrast, in the myotodont condition the cristid connects the hypoconid with the entoconid, thus excluding the hypoconuild from the talonid basin.

This character is part of a multistate description that is equivalent to the description of the hypoflexid Gunnell et al. (2008: pgs. 3, 6).  The cristid obliqua originates from the hypoconid; this character describes the orientation of the cristid obliqua at its mesial end where it approaches the trigonid (as seen in occlusal view).

225. Lower molars entocristid distrupted [[Based on Hand (1998: fig 3).  The entocristid (= prentocristid) extends mesially from the entoconid.  This character describes whether or not the entocristid contacts the postvalid (= posterior wall of the trigonid); this varies independently from the height of the entocristid (e.g., Myzopoda has a high entocristid but one that is distrupted).

This character is part of a multistate description that is equivalent to the description of the hypoflexid Gunnell et al. (2008: pgs. 3, 6).  The cristid obliqua originates from the hypoconid; this character describes where it terminates relative to the trigonid, i.e., the extent of the cristid obliqua at its mesial end.

Some taxa may also have a postentocristid (extending posteriorly from the entoconid) but that is not what is being scored here.  Height of the entocristid varies independently of flexion of this crest, which is scored in a separate character for the lower molars as a group.

252. Lower m2 and m3 relative height of paraconid and metaconid [[Based on Hand et al. (2001: pg. 143).  Can be scored only in taxa where both cusps are present. M1 differs from M2/M3 in some taxa (e.g., Macrotus).  Ordered.]] subequal in height (0); paraconid slightly shorter than metaconid (1); paraconid markedly shorter than metaconid (2).
  

253. Lower m2 and m3 precingulum [[Cingulum located anterior to paraconid.]] absent (0); present (1).
  

254. Lower m2 and m3 precingulid and labial cingulid connected. [[Can only be scored in taxa that have a precingulid and labial cingulid present.]] not connected (0); cingulids confluent around mesiolabial corner of tooth (1).
  

255. Lower m2 presence [[From Wetterer et al. (2000:  character 65); Giannini and Simmons (2005: character 54).]] m2 present (0); absent (1).
  

256. Lower m2 crown morphology [[From Giannini and Simmons (2005: character 54).  Ordered.  States 1 and 2 in some pteropodids.  "Simplifed crown structure" refers to reduced cusps and crests across the whole tooth crown, not loss of one or two cusps on an otherwise similar tooth.  Ordered.]] m2 with crown structure resembling m1 (0); simplified cuspidate structure compared to m1 (1); m2 peg-like with flattened crown (2).
  

257. Lower m2 height of trigonid relative to talonid cusps [[Based on Hand et al. (1994: pg. 376); Hand et al. (2001: pg. 143).  We have chosen to compare the height of the protoconid and hypoconid since these cusps are always present, easy to see in both labial and lingual views, and tend to be representative of the other cusps in terms of trigonid vs talonid cusp height.  Split into three characters (one for each molar locus) since the condition varies across loci in some taxa. Ordered.]] protoconid markedly higher than hypoconid (0); protoconid slightly higher than hypoconid (1); protoconid and hypoconid subequal in height (2).
  

258. Lower m2 labial cingulid development [[Modified from Hand et al. (1994: pg. 379); Gunnell et al. (2008: pg. 8); Hand et al. (2001: pg. 142); Storch et al. (2002: pg. 196).  Ordered.  According to Hand et al. (1994), presence of a well developed buccal cingulum may be a synapomorphy of bats.  Described by Hand et al. (2001: 142) as "sinuous" in some taxa (e.g. molossids), need to deterimine if shape varies as well as degree of development.  ]] strongly developed (0); weakly developed (1); absent (2).
  

259. Lower m2 labial cingulid completeness [[Based on Smith et al. (2007: pg. 1005, 1007).  Score only in taxa with a labial cingulid (ectocingulid) present. Unordered.]] labial cingulid complete (0); incomplete posteriorly (1); incomplete anteriorly (2).
  

260. Lower m2 entoconid development [[Modified from Wetterer et al. (2000: character 70); Smith et al. (2007: pg. 1005, 1007).  Ordered.  Needs to be quantified somehow.]] strongly developed, tall (0); weakly developed, low (1); very weak, small (2); absent (3).

Refers to maximum width of talonid compared to maximum width of trigonid as measured from the lingual to the labial side of the tooth in occlusal view.

264. Lower m3 crown morphology [[Modified from Giannini and Simmons (2005: character 54).  In state 1, the morphology of the crown of m3 is distinctly different from m2, frequently involving reduction of cusps and crests across the whole tooth crown, not loss of one or two cusps on an otherwise similar tooth.]] m3 crown morphology similar to that of m2 (0); m3 markedly different from m2 (1).
  

265. Lower m3 length [[Based on Gunnell et al. (2008: pg. 2, 9); Hand et al. (2001: pg. 142).  Ordered.]] m3 length subequal to that of m2 (0); m3 slightly shorter (>75%) than m2 (1); m3 length much less than m2 (2).

269. Lower m3 extent of cristid obliqua [[Modified from Simmons and Conway (2001: character 47); Hand et al. (1994: pg. 379); Smith et al. (2007: pg. 1008).  This character is part of a multistate description that is equivalent to the description of the hypoflexid Gunnell et al. (2008: pgs. 3, 6).  The cristid obliqua originates from the hypoconid; this character describes where it terminates relative to the trigonid, i.e., the extent of the cristid obliqua at its mesial end.  In many taxa it reaches the posterior wall of the tridonid, but in some forms it terminates before reaching that wall.  In a few taxa the cristid obliqua is entirely absent.  Ordered.]] reaches trigon (0); present but does not reach trigon (1); cristid obliqua absent (2).
  

270. Lower m3 hypoconid presence [[New character.]] present (0); absent (1).
  

271. Lower m3 height of protoconid relative to hypoconid [[Based on Hand et al. (1994: pg. 376); Hand et al. (2001: pg. 143).  We have chosen to compare the height of the protoconid and hypoconid since these cusps are always present, easy to see in both labial and lingual views, and tend to be representative of the other cusps in terms of trigonid vs talonid cusp height.  Split into three characters (one for each molar locus) since the condition varies across loci in some taxa.  Can be scored only in taxa having both a protoconid and a hypoconid.  Ordered.]] protoconid notably higher than hypoconid (0); protoconid slightly higher than hypoconid (1); protoconid and hypoconid subequal in height (2); protoconid smaller than hypoconid (3).
  

272. Lower m3 hypoflexid depth [[Based on Gunnell et al. (2008: pgs. 3, 6).  Refers to an indentation in the labial base of the tooth as seen in occlusal view.  Needs better state descriptors.  May be correlated with the position of termination of the cristid obliqua.  Ordered.]] absent (0); shallow (1); deep (2).
  

273. Lower m3 entocristid orientation [[Based on Smith et al. (2007: pg. 1008).  Can only be scored on taxa that do not have a flexed entocristid.  Ordered.]] transverse to long axis of tooth (0); oblique to long axis of tooth (1); parallel to long axis of tooth (2).
  

274. Lower m3 presence of postcristid [[Absent in Megaderma.]] present (0); absent (1).
  

275. Lower m3 postcristid orientation [[Based on Smith et al. (2007: pg. 1008).  Refers to the crest that runs labially from the hypoconid to either the hypoconulid or entoconid.]] directed posterolabially at an oblique angle to the long axis of the tooth (0); perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth (1).
  

276. Lower m3 hypoconulid presence [[]] present (0); absent (1).
  

277. Lower m3 hypoconulid size [[Based on Hand et al. (1994: pg. 379), Gunnell et al. (2008: pgs. 6, 7); Storch et al. (2002: pg. 195).  Ordered.]] large (0); small and low (1).
  278. Lower m3 talonid width [[Based on Gunnell et al. (2008: pgs 3, 5, 7); Hand et al. (2001: pg. 12, 13); Smith et al. (2007: pg. 1007). Refers to maximum width of talonid compared to maximum width of trigonid as measured from the lingual to the labial side of the tooth in occlusal view.  When the talonid is narrower than the trigonid, it may be referred to as "blade-like." By convention, for this character we measure the maximum width of the tooth across the talonid region (usually that occurs roughly across where the hyponid is to the middle of the opposite side of the tooth, sometimes the entoconid is there but sometimes not) and compare it to the maximum width across the trigonid (usually from protonid region straight across).  The measurements go roughly perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. Ordered.]] talonid wider than trigonid (0); talonid and trigonid subequal (1); talonid narrower than trigonid (2).
