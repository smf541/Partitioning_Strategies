Paterimitra); 3=spherical; 4=Fusiform","The brephic shell is the shell possessed by the young organism (see Ushatinskaya & Korovnikov 2016R and Popov et al. 2010 for discussion of terminology). Micrina resembles linguliforms (Holmer et al. 2011): in both, the brephic mitral shell has one pair of setal sacs enclosed by lateral lobes, whereas the brephic ventral shell has two lateral setal tubes. Paterimitra and Salanygolina have ""identical"" ventral brephic shells (Holmer et al 2011), resembling the shape of a ship's propeller. Haplophrentis is coded following typical hyoliths, which have a spherical brephic shell; Pedunculotheca's, in contrast, is seemingly cap-shaped.",transformational,Juvenile,Shell

This latter pair may be termed the vascula media, but whether they are strictly homologous with the vascula media of articulated brachiopods is a matter of opinion. It is also impossible to assert that the vascula lateralia are the homologues of the vascula myaria or genitalia of articulated species, although they are likely to be so as they arise in a comparable position.""  ""In inarticulated brachiopods, two main mantle canals (vascula lateralia) emerge from the main body cavity through muscular valves and bifurcate distally to produce an increasingly dense array of blindly ending branches near the periphery of the mantle (fig. 71.1-71.2).""",neomorphic,Adult,Mantle

It is unlikely that the tentacles of annelids and sipunculans correspond to the lophophore, yet homology is not inconceivable.  In order that the tentacular apparatus of Haplophrentis can be compared with both organs without prejudice, we capture the presence of a tentacular apparatus in this very broad character, with arguments against homology reflected in separate transformation series.",neomorphic,Adult,Feeding.and.Digestion

Punctae are 10-20 um wide and represent multicellular extensions of the outer epithelium (Owen and Williams 1969). Pseudopunctae and extropunctae are similar in diameter but, instead of canals, are vertical stacks of conical deflections of individual shell layers (Williams and Brunton 1993). None of these three types of vertical shell structure, all of which are confined to calcitic-shelled brachiopods, compares with the much smaller canals (&lt; 1 um in diameter) of M. nuda. The only type of vertical structure that fits the size and nature of the canals of the Mural obolellids are the canals of linguliform brachiopods, which range in width from 180 to 740 nm and are occupied by proteinaceous strands in extant taxa (Williams et al. 1992; Williams et al. 1994; Williams et al. 1997). In contrast to obolellid canals, however, linguliform canals are not known to penetrate the entire shell but terminate in organic-rich layers (Williams 1997). Based on these considerations it would, therefore, be misleading to call obolellid shells punctate (they are as much ""punctate"" as acrotretids or other linguliforms); rather their shell structure should be called canaliculate (Williams 1997).""",neomorphic,Adult,Shell
