[   Step                --  Index of the step ]
[   Power               --  At each step we sample from the distribution with density (Likelihood^Power)*Prior ]
[   runX                --  Contribution to the marginal log likelihood of run X, i.e. marginal log likelihood for run X is the sum across all steps in column runX.   ]
[   aSplitX             --  Average standard deviation of split frequencies of tree X. -2.0 is printed if no diagnostics was requested. -1.0 is printed if there were no splits with frequency above minimum.]
