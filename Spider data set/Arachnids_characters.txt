Arachnids (Agnarsson 2004) character list


Epigynal ventral margin : (0) entire (Fig. 15G); (1) with scape (Fig. 27D). Epigynal scapes are widespread in araneoid spiders (see e.g. Scharff & Coddington, 1997: character 28), but to my best knowledge, Anelosimus pulchellus and A. vittatus, along with A. ethicus (pers. observ.), are unique among theridiids in having an araneid-like epigynal scape. Thymoites unimaculatum has a similar ventral scape-like projection (Fig. 85F), here considered putatively homologous, although the homology is rejected on the cladogram.

Epigynal dorsal plate : (0) absent; (1) present. Pimoids and linyphiids typically have a distinct dorsal plate in the epigynum (see e.g. Millidge, 1984: fig. 9; Hormiga, 1994a: fig. 60). Such a plate is absent in theridiids and other taxa in this study (e.g. Figs 2E, 7E, 12E, 33E, 45F, 50C, 55A, 59F, 63A, 64G, 86G, 93F, G).

Epigynal plate surface : (0) smooth (Fig. 12E); (1) ridged (Fig. 21G). In most theridiids the epigynal plate is smooth (e.g. Figs 12E, 40B). On this cladogram the presence of conspicuous ridges on the epigynal plate is a synapomorphy of Anelosimus (e.g. Figs 21G, 24G) secondarily lost in clade 19 (Fig. 29A). Presumably the theridiid epigynal plate is a homologue of the ventral plate of linyphioids.

Copulatory pore position : (0) caudal, under a dorsal plate; (1) ventral. A conspicuous projection overlies the copulatory openings in many araneoids (see e.g. Pimoa rupicola in Hormiga, 1994a: figs 27−29). In theridiids and Synotaxus, such a projection is generally absent and the openings are thus clearly visible in ventral view (Figs 12E, 22G, 69G). This character is inapplicable to the haplogyne Tetragnatha.

Copulatory pore shape : (0) wide (Figs 45F, 53F); (1) narrow slits (Figs 38F, 41G, 61G, 68G, 74G, 80F).

Copulatory bursa, anterior margin : (0) entire, broadly transverse (Fig. 19B); (1) medially acute (Figs 22G, 40B).

Copulatory duct, spermathecal junction : (0) posterior; (1) lateral or anterior. Most commonly the copulatory ducts enter the spermathecae posteriorly or basally (Fig. 93J), but in a few taxa medially or anteriorly (Fig. 93H).

Copulatory duct trajectory : (0) straight, or at most a single simple loop (Fig. 93H, I); (1) two or more loops (Fig. 93J).

Copulatory duct loops relative to spermathecae : (0) apart (Fig. 93H, I); (1) encircling (Fig. 93J). In Latrodectus and independently in Kochiura, the copulatory ducts wrap around the spermathecae.

Spermathecal number : (0) two (Fig. 93H, J); (1) four (Fig. 93I). G98-26. Many hadrotarsines have two pairs of spermathecae: Anatea, Audifia, Dipoena, Dipoenata, Emertonella, Euryopis, Guaraniella, Lasaeola, Trigonobothrys, Yaginumena, Yoroa and some Hadrotarsus (Hickman, 1943; Levi & Levi, 1962; Wunderlich, 1978; Baert, 1984a, b; Forster et al., 1990; Griswold et al., 1998; Harvey & Waldock, 2000;,Yoshida, 2002). The monotypic Gmogala scarabaeus Keyserling, however, has one pair of spermathecae, as do some species of Hadrotarsus and Euryopis, and a number of new genera from Australia (M. Harvey, pers. comm.). Genera with both conditions may not be monophyletic; this character will be important in future phylogenetic studies of Hadrotarsinae. On this cladogram the possession of four spermathecae is synapomorphic for Hadrotarsinae.

Spermathecal shape : (0) ovoid; (1) elongate; (2) dumbbell. Spermathecae are most commonly ovoid in shape, and this is certainly true of most theridiids (Fig. 93H, I). In this cladogram highly elongate spermathecae are an autapomorphy of Ariamnes cf. attenuatus, and appear to be a synapomorphy of that genus. Dumbbell-shaped spermathecae are here a synapomorphy of Latrodectus (Levi & Levi, 1962: fig. 253).

Spermathecal accessory lobes : (0) absent; (1) present. Most nesticids have distinct ‘accessory lobes’ associated with the spermathecae (e.g. Gertsch, 1984:Nesticus silvestrii, fig. 184, Eidmanella pallida, figs 260, 262).

Fertilization duct sclerotization (Accessory sac) : (0) light; (1) thick and heavy (Synotaxus). Exline & Levi (1965: 179) noted that the fertilization ducts of Synotaxus ‘… are much more sclerotized than in the other theridiid genera.’. I have noted sac-like areas of strong sclerotization in Synotaxus epigyna (see Agnarsson, 2003c) using the term ‘accessory sac’), however, it is not clear that they are a part of the fertilization ducts.

Male palpal tibial distal end : (0) subequal or slightly wider than base; (1) distinctly broadened, = >2 × base width. Male palpal tibia shape alone usually suffices to identify a spider as a theridiid, although the complexity and variability of tibial shapes make it difficult to define precisely the components involved. This and the following three characters attempt to define and convey the information clearly and objectively. In araneoid spiders the palpal tibia is usually slightly to moderately tapered, so that the base is considerably narrower than the tibial tip (Fig. 1A, C), and somewhat narrower than the patella at their articulation. The theridiid tibial tip is twice to several times wider, at its widest point, than the base (Figs 4E, 37A, C, 42B, C), and the base is much narrower than the patella at the joint. On this cladogram the modification is a synapomorphy of Theridiidae.

Male palpal tibial rim : (0) uniform or only slightly asymmetric (Fig. 1A–C); (1) strongly and asymmetrically protruding, scoop-shaped (Fig. 36D). In most araneoids the male palpal tibial distal rim protrudes only slightly on one side; normally the protruding portion faces the dorsal side of the cymbium. In many theridiids the rim is strongly exaggerated on one side, scoop-shaped, and faces the ventral side of the cymbium or the palpal bulb (Figs 10A, 13A, 22B, 24C, 31A–C, 36B–D, 39A, 42A–C, 48A, 51A, B, 79B, 81A–C, see also character 17).

Male palpal tibial rim setal conformation : (0) irregular; (1) regular row of long, strong setae. The theridiid tibial rim has a regularly arranged row of long, strong seta (Figs 13C, 15A, C, 42B, 83E), most extreme in Kochiura aulica (Fig. 51A–C). The tibial setae of hadrotarsines (Fig. 4A, B), Synotaxus (Fig. 1A–C) or Nesticus (Fig. 2A–C), as in most other araneoids, are neither so regularly arranged, nor uniformly long and strong. On this cladogram, the feature is a synapomorphy of the SPR clade (clade 50). However, a similar condition occurs in some pimoids and linyphiids (e.g. Pocobletus coroniger, G. Hormiga, pers. comm.) and in some hadrotarsines.

Male palpal tibial rim relative to cymbium : (0) protruding tibial rim faces dorsal cymbial margin; (1) protruding tibial rim faces bulb. In most theridiids the protruding margin of the male tibia faces the palpal bulb (Fig. 51A).

Male palpal tibia, retrolateral trichobothria : (0) three or more; (1) two; (2) one or none. The number and distribution of trichobothria on the male palpi seems quite informative phylogenetically, even though it varies widely among araneoids, even within genera (e.g. Hormiga, 1994a). Synotaxus and theridioids primitively have two retrolateral and one prolateral trichobothria (Figs 24C, 31G, 69E, 92D–F, vs. more in other outgroups). Reduction to a single retrolateral trichobothria (Figs 81A, 92G) (or uniquely in Carniella in this matrix, to none, Fig. 36B–D) occurred at least five times in theridiids, but although homoplasious (CI = 0.25), in most instances the reduction is informative (RI = 0.76). The same applies to reduction in prolateral trichobothria (19).

Male palpal tibia, prolateral trichobothria : (0) two or more; (1) one; (2) none.

Male palpal patella spur : (0) absent (Figs 13F, 46F); (1) present. Synotaxus males have a uniquely modified, grossly enlarged, seta on the palpal patella (Fig. 1A, C). This patellar spur is a synapomorphy of Synotaxus.

 Cymbium : (0) entire; (1) expanded retrolaterally. G98-5. On this cladogram a retrolaterally expanded cymbium is an autapomorphy of Pimoa, and therefore uninformative. Because it occurs in Cyatholipidae, it has been scored here in case its distribution becomes relevant to the placement of pimoids, cyatholipoids, or theridioids.

Cymbial retromargin : (0) entire (Fig. 28E, F); (1) with a small distal apophysis containing the cymbial hood (Ameridion, Fig. 13B, E); (2) synotaxid retromargin-groove. G98-6.

Cymbium dorsobasal margin : (0) entire (Figs 28A, C, 31A, C); (1) strongly incised (Figs 10C, 12C); (2) strongly modified, with a ridge of parallel teeth (Tidarren, Fig. 86D, F). An incised cymbial dorsobasal margin is a synapomorphy of Achaearanea (Fig. 10C). The cymbium of Tidarren is extremely modified (Fig. 86D–F), unlike any other taxa in this study, making comparisons difficult. No doubt many features of the Tidarren cymbium support the monophyly of the genus, but as only a single species is present here, only one conspicuous feature, a ridge of parallel teeth on (what is presumed to be) the dorsobasal margin, is exemplified (Fig. 86F).

Cymbial distal promargin : (0) entire; (1) with an apophysis (Argyrodes, Figs 31D, 92E; Crustulina, Fig. 42A, B); (2) constricted and flattened (Latrodectus, Fig. 54B, C).

Cymbial mesial margin : (0) entire (Figs 31A, 39A, 41A, 44A); (1) incised (Anelosimus, Figs 17D, 20A). Many Anelosimus have a distinct incision on the cymbial mesial margin (Fig. 17D) and on this cladogram the feature is a synapomorphy of clade 22 [Anelosimus exclusive of A. vittatus (Fig. 26A, C) and A. pulchellus ].

Cymbial tip sclerotization : (0) like rest of cymbium; (1) lightly sclerotized, appears white. The tip of the cymbium appears white, or lightly sclerotized, in many Anelosimus species. As seen in the expanded palp (e.g. A. eximius, Fig., 18A) the inner lining of the tip of the cymbium folds down to form a part of the cymbial hood. In air-dried Anelosimus specimens the tip of the cymbium typically collapses due to this light sclerotization. On this cladogram the lightly sclerotized cymbial tip is a synapomorphy of clade 20.

Cymbial tip setae : (0) like other setae (Fig. 1A, B); (1) thick and strongly curved (Kochiura, Figs 51B, 52C).

Cymbial sheath : (0) absent (Fig. 26B, C); (1) present. Several theridiids with extremely long emboli have a sclerotized groove on the ectal cymbial margin that supports the spiralling embolus (Fig. 52C).

Paracymbium : (0) present (Fig. 92A–C); (1) absent (Fig. 92D−M). G98-7. The presence of a proximal, retrolateral process on the cymbium has long been identified cladistically as a synapomorphy of Araneoidea (Coddington, 1986c, 1990a, b; Hormiga et al., 1995). Theridiids lack such a process, but have a distal process on the cymbial ventral margin or inside the cymbium, which forms a hook or a hood that function uniquely to lock the unexpanded bulb in the cymbium (compare the PC in Nesticus, Fig. 2B, the cymbial hook in Argyrodes, Fig. 31F). Levi (1961),,Heimer (1982) and Heimer & Nentwig (1982) pointed out that in what they considered the more basal theridiid genera (e.g. Robertus), the hook is structurally similar to the paracymbium of some araneoids and is situated on the ectal margin rather than distally within the cymbium. This led them and other authors (e.g. Shear, 1967; Coddington, 1986c, 1990a; Hormiga et al., 1995; Knoflach, 1996;,Levy, 1998) to homologize the theridiid hook with the paracymbium of other araneoids, contraSaaristo (1978). However, the structural similarity is superficial, and the condition in the most basal theridiids (which are not those considered basal by previous authors), differs clearly from the paracymbium both in structure, topology and function. Therefore, I conclude that the theridiid process and the araneoid paracymbium are not homologous, in agreement with Griswold et al. (1998). On this cladogram the loss of the araneoid PC is a synapomorphy of Theridiidae.

Paracymbial form : (0) Argiope-like (Fig. 92A); (1) Tetragnatha-like (Fig. 92B); (2) pimoid-like (Fig. 89A); (3) linyphiid-like (Fig. 89B); (4) cup-shaped (Fig. 89C); (5) Nesticus-like (Figs 2B, 89D, 92C). G98-9. The paracymbium varies so much that homology statements at the family level are very difficult. Hormiga et al. (1995) and Griswold et al. (1998) essentially gave up trying to homologize overall form or morphological parts and instead adopted an exemplar approach, naming the various types by the taxa in which they occur. The same approach and coding is followed here. On this cladogram the cup-shaped PC is a synapomorphy of Synotaxus. Nesticids are also united by a unique form of PC (Figs 2B, 89D), while those found in other taxa are all autapomorphic for them.

Bulb-cymbium lock mechanism (BC lock) : (0) absent (Figs 2A, B, 92A–C); (1) present (Figs 28F, 44D). G98-12. As mentioned above, theridiids have a unique type of bulb-to-cymbium locking mechanism. The cymbial hook or hood interacts with the bulb (normally the MA) to ‘lock’ it to the cymbium in the unexpanded palp. The lock may also play an important role in controlling the rotation of the palp during natural expansion (e.g. Knoflach, 1998). On this cladogram the presence of a BC lock mechanism is a synapomorphy of Theridiidae.

Lock placement (Chk and Chd) : (0) basal (Carniella, Fig. 36C); (1) distal (Figs 67B, 92D−I, M); (2) central (Fig. 92H).

Lock mechanism : (0) hook (Figs 31F, 60D, 91A, 92D, E, J−L); (1) hood only (Figs, 18A, 75B, 92F−I, M); (2) Theridula (Fig. 81D). Forster et al. (1990), argued convincingly for the homology of the theridiid cymbial hook and the identically situated cymbial hood. Accordingly, these are treated here as alternative states of the same character. On this cladogram the cymbial part of the lock mechanism is primitively hooked. The transition to a hood takes place in the lineage leading to Anelosimus plus Theridiinae (the lost colulus clade). The alternative interpretation is less parsimonious, requiring both the loss of a hook and the gain of a hood at the same node on the cladogram. This interpretation would unjustly inflate the number of synapomorphies for the lost colulus clade, beyond the variation observed. The condition in Theridula is autapomorphic; a distal sclerite of a membranous texture physically connects the bulb and the cymbium. It seems simplest to assume that this sclerite is a highly modified MA, although, its topology is most unusual.

Cymbial hook orientation : (0) facing downwards (Figs 91A, 92D, E, J, K); (1) facing upwards (Figs 60C, D, 67B, 92L).

Cymbial hook location : (0) inside cymbium (Fig. 92D, E, J, K); (1) ectal cymbial margin (Figs 66B, C, 67B).

Cymbial hook inferior groove : (0) absent (Fig. 66B); (1) present (Fig. 92D, J, K). In some theridiids with the hook-lock system there is a distinct groove beneath the hook. This groove seems not to be homologous to the hood-lock system, based on similarity, as it is absent in the lineages sister to the lost colulus clade (although see below). The ‘hood’ of Spintharus (Fig. 92M), a species nested deep within the hook-lock grade, is quite similar to the hook inferior groove present in other spintharines (Thwaitesia and Episinus, Fig. 92J), and differs from the typical hood morphology (e.g. Theridion frondeumFig. 75B). The uniqueness of the Spintharus condition is strongly supported by character congruence (tree topology is identical regardless of how the Spintharus hood is coded), and the homology of the Spintharus condition to that of the unrelated lost colulus clade is unambiguously refuted. On this cladogram the secondary hood occurs in the grade Hadrotarsinae-Spintharinae-Latrodectinae, but its absence is a synapomorphy of the remaining theridiids. A complication to this interpretation of cymbium lock system homologies is the presence of a hook inferior groove in Kochiura. Although here coded as a groove, the phylogenetic position of Kochiura may indicate that its condition is an intermediate between the ‘hook’ and ‘hood’ lock systems (33), in which case it should be coded as having both (being polymorphic for 33).

Cymbial hook distal portion : (0) blunt (Figs 31F, 92D, E); (1) tapering to a sharp tip (Figs 66B, 67D, 92L). A strongly tapered cymbial hook characterizes some pholcommatines. Enoplognatha has a moderately tapered hook, which might be represented by a third step.

Cymbial hood size : (0) narrow (Fig. 92F–H); (1) broad (Fig. 92I); (2) Spintharu s-like (Fig. 92M). The hood in most theridiids is small relative to the distal width of the cymbium. In Anelosimus rupununi and A. lorenzo, however, the distinctly widened hood occupies nearly the whole width of the distal cymbium. The hood type found in Spintharus is unique and apparently is not homologous to that present in the lost colulus clade.

Cymbial hood region : (0) translucent, hood visible through cymbium (Anelosimus, Figs 90A, 91C); (1) opaque, hood not visible. Usually the cymbial hood is not visible in the unexpanded palp. In some Anelosimus, the outline of the hood is clearly visible through the translucent cuticle of the cymbial margin.

Bulbal sclerite of lock mechanism : (0) MA; (1) embolus base. In most theridiids the BC lock involves the MA (Figs 28F, 31F). Many Achaearanea (and some Theridion not considered in this study), however, have lost the MA (see below) and in this case the base of the embolus assumes the function (Figs 10B, 12A). On this cladogram the embolus base as part of the BC lock is a synapomorphy of Achaearanea.

Alveolus placement : (0) ectal; (1) central; (2) mesial. In theridiids and Pimoa the alveolus usually abuts the mesial margin of the cymbium (Fig. 92D–I, M). In the other outgroup taxa considered here, the alveolus is either central (Fig. 92B, C) or ectal (Fig. 92A) in the cymbium. On this cladogram the shift to a mesial placement of the alveolus is a synapomorphy of theridiids, and the reversal to a central location defines Achaearanea.

Alveolar cavity : (0) simple, unsclerotized; (1) with alveolar sclerite. The alveolar cavity of Thwaitesia contains a conspicuous sclerite, which is autapomorphic in this context but possibly a synapomorphy of the genus. The genus Pimoa, synapomorphically, has a somewhat similar sclerite present, but that sclerite is clearly distal to the alveolar cavity (Hormiga, 1994a: 6, fig. 303; Hormiga, 2003) and thus not presumed here to be homologous.

Alveolus shape : (0) circular or oval (Fig. 92A–H); (1) with a mesial extension (Fig. 92I).

Subtegular retrolateral margin : (0) entire (e.g. Figs 4A, B, 10A); (1) with a prominent rounded lobe (Fig. 2A, B).

Tegulum size : (0) < half cymbial cavity (normal, e.g. Figs 41A, B, 79C); (1) huge, > half cymbial cavity (Dipoena, Fig. 4B, C). On this cladogram the presence of a huge tegulum, occupying more than half of the cymbial cavity, is an autapomorphy of Dipoena nigra (Fig. 4B, C), Tidarren (Fig. 86E), and a synapomorphy of two Anelosimus species from Tanzania (Fig. 28C). However, the condition is found in several Dipoena and some other hadrotarsines, e.g. Eurypoena (Wunderlich, 1992), Gmogala (Wunderlich, 1978), Guaraniella (Baert, 1984b), Emertonella, Trigonobothrys, Yaginumena (Yoshida, 2002) Yoroa (Baert, 1984a; Harvey & Waldock, 2000), and other undescribed genera (M. Harvey pers. comm.). The conspicuous ridges on the tegulum of D. nigra (Fig. 4C, D) have not been seen in other Dipoena examined, but may be relevant in a species-level phylogenetic study.

Tegulum ectal margin : (0) entire (Fig. 1B); (1) protruded (Fig. 20D). Anelosimus cf. jucundus has a tegular outgrowth on the ectal margin, extending beyond the embolus base. A. cf. jucundus may be a species complex and the character is included here in anticipation of its use in Anelosimus phylogeny.

Tegular groove : (0) absent (Fig. 10A); (1) present (Fig. 28B). Tanzanian Anelosimus sp. 1 and 2 have a unique groove in the tegulum where a part of the E spiral rests.

Tegular arch : (0) absent (Fig. 10A); (1) present. Achaearanea wau and A. vervoorti both have an unusual elevated ridge centrally on the tegulum (Fig. 12A, arrow).

Tegular pit : (0) absent (Fig. 10A, B); (1) present. The inside of the ectal rim of the tegulum bears a conspicuous pit in many members of the Theridiinae (Fig. 75A, B), which seems to function in yet another palpal locking mechanism. The pit interacts with the base of the embolus directly or an embolic apophysis (see next character). The optimization is ambiguous, but under ACCTRAN a tegular pit is synapomorphic for Theridiinae, with secondary loss defining clades 8 and 12.

Tegular pit embolic interaction : (0) via embolic base (Fig. 39E); (1) via embolic apophysis (Fig. 75A, B).

Sperm duct trajectory. The palpal sperm duct is often considered as having three distinct parts: the fundus is the proximal end and is enlarged to form a pouch; the reservoir is a long tube spiralling throughout the tegulum and sometimes inside tegular sclerites; the ejaculatory duct is terminal and inside the embolus (Comstock, 1910). Primitively, the sperm duct appears to form approximately one simple spiral in the tegulum (see Coddington, 1990a for discussion and examples). In many araneoids, however, the sperm duct trajectory is moderately to very complex with numerous spirals and switchbacks (Figs 90B, D, 93A–E). Coddington (1986a), homologized individual loops and switchbacks of the theridiosomatid reservoir, and showed that the system can be of great utility in spider systematics. In theridiids the sperm duct trajectory (SDT) varies greatly and understanding the variation requires the laborious construction of wire models (see Methods) whose accuracy may be hard to verify. The following is a preliminary and speculative attempt to reduce this complexity to homology statements (note that tree topology is not dependent on these characters; removing all SDT characters yields the same single mpt). Some switchbacks and loops seem consistent enough to allow specific homology conjectures across theridiids and outgroups. These more consistent and recognizable switchbacks identify regions of the sperm duct, which enable the comparison of less consistent loops and switchbacks. The characters that follow are based on left palps.

SDT Switchbacks (SB) I & II : (0) present; (1) absent. The sperm duct pathway typically travels clockwise in the left palp and completes about one spiral in the tegulum before forming a double switchback (SB I, II, Figs 90B, D, 93A–E). SB I reverses the trajectory to counter-clockwise, but SB II immediately restores it to clockwise. Both are either absent or present simultaneously in all taxa considered in this study and are thus treated as a single character.

SDT SB I : (0) separate; (1) touching. The two arms of the switchback may be separated, or so close that they nearly touch.

SDT SB II : (0) entirely in tegulum; (1) terminates in embolus. In Achaearanea the duct enters the embolus during SB II, whereas in other taxa it continues its trajectory within the tegulum after SB II.

SDT post-SB II turn : (0) absent; (1) present (Anelosimus, Fig. 93B). In some Anelosimus (clade, 18) the sperm duct makes an abrupt 90-degree dive into the tegulum immediately after the first double switchback. This turn, if present, is more gradual in other taxa.

SDT SB I & II reservoir segment alignment : (0) divergent; (1) parallel. Three reservoir segments make up SB I & II. They may be nearly perfectly parallel to one another in the tegulum (Fig. 93A), or more commonly the angles between them are somewhat divergent (Fig. 93E, SB I angle much more obtuse than SB II).

SDT SB I & II orientation : (0) in plane of first loop from fundus; (1) out of plane of first loop, against tegular wall.

SDT RSB I & II : (0) absent; (1) present. In the argyrodines the trajectory of the sperm duct is unusual in that the duct makes two complete switchbacks before SB I & II. These are in reverse orientation to SB I & II (switching towards the fundus rather than towards the embolus) and are thus termed reverse switchbacks I & II (RSB I & II, Fig. 93D, E).

SDT SB III : (0) absent; (1) present. Having completed SB I & II the duct may simply loop until entering the embolus (Figs 90D, 93B) or, in some cases, switchbacks even more (Fig. 93D, E). When a SB occurs inside the MA, it is the SB III. In some taxa (e.g. Crustulina, Latrodectus, Steatoda) the duct enters the MA, but does not reverse its trajectory inside it (no SB III). SB III may also be present in taxa where the duct does not enter MA (e.g. Coleosoma).

SDT SB IV : (0) absent; (1) present (Fig. 93E). Given the presence of SB III, in some cases an additional switchback occurs between SB III, the embolus (SB IV, Fig. 93E).

SDT entering embolus : (0) clockwise (left palp, ventral view); (1) counter-clockwise.

SDT constriction : (0) relatively gradual; (1) duct narrows abruptly before SB I. Usually the sperm duct diameter is relatively constant or changes gradually, and constricts somewhat prior to entering the embolus. In contrast, in the latrodectines, the duct is unusually broad after leaving the fundus, but constricts markedly and abruptly in the tegulum.

Conductor : (0) present; (1) absent. G98-14. Homology of palpal sclerites of male spiders at higher taxonomic levels is problematic (Coddington, 1990a). The few ontogenetic studies to date suggest that the conductor and the MA are intimately associated in male palp ontogeny, arising from the dorsal lobe of the pedipalpal claw fundament, while all other parts of the palp arise from the ventral lobe (Bhatnagar & Rempel, 1962).,Griswold et al. (1998) followed the rule of thumb that if only one tegular sclerite is present, by default it is considered to be the conductor. If an additional tegular sclerite is present it is the MA. However, at least within Theridiidae, it seems to be possible to construct sensible primary homology hypotheses based on similarity criteria, in particular topological similarity and relation of sclerites with the tegulum (Griswold et al., 1998 also found such criteria useful when two or more sclerites were present). Here the conductor is considered to be a sclerite that is an outgrowth of the tegulum, lying always on, or lateral to, a distinct sclerotized tegular knob above the embolus in the bulb. In most theridiids the conductor is the only palpal sclerite completely fused to the tegulum, whereas the MA, in the theridiids considered here, is flexibly attached. Superficial examination may mistake the TTA for the C, as the former often functions as a conductor. Dissection of the palp, however, readily allows correct identification. On this cladogram the conductor has been independently lost several times. Its loss is autapomorphic in Linyphia triangularis (Fig. 89B), and Eidmanella pallida (while present in Nesticus, Fig. 2C) and a synapomorphy of Emertonella plus Euryopis, and of Synotaxus. It is further absent in Cerocida and Phoroncidia. This and the following characters are coded as unknown in Carniella siam because the presence of a conductor in Carniella is uncertain (Fig. 36A, arrow pointing to an unusual outgrowth of the tegulum, possibly a conductor).

Conductor distal portion : (0) width subequal to base (Figs 10A, 13D, 91A−I); (1) grossly enlarged (Figs 46A–E, 67B, 69B, 83A, B, 90F, G). Spintharines are characterized by the presence of an enormous conductor (Fig. 46A–E). A huge fan shaped conductor is also a synapomorphy of Selkirkiella (Fig. 67B). Kochiura has a long, distally widened conductor (Fig. 52B). Helvibis cf. longicaudatus (Fig. 49A–C) appears autapomorphic in this dataset, but an elongated conductor is probably a generic synapomorphy.

Conductor : (0) with a groove for the embolus (Figs 10A, 28D, 69B); (1) entire (Figs 13D, 17F, 52C, D).

Conductor surface : (0) smooth (Figs 75B, 77B, C); (1) heavily ridged (Figs 10B, C, 12B, 44D, 67C, 69D). Nesticodes has strong ridges on an outgrowth of the conductor (Fig. 58B), treated here as potentially homologous.

Conductor folding : (0) entire; (1) complex (spintharines, Figs 46B, 69B, 83B, 90F, G); (2) Helvibis (Fig. 49A–C). The spintharine conductor is large and complexly folded, unlike the conductor of any other theridiids. The Helvibis conductor is also unique, being thin, extremely elongated and membranous. However, it follows the E tip closely and does not fold upon itself.

Conductor tip sclerotization : (0) similar to base; (1) more than base.

Conductor base : (0) entire; (1) grooved. The latrodectine conductor base is hollow and forms a groove into which a hook on the embolus base loosely fits (Fig. 54E). This is possibly homologous with the subconductor (70), or the tegular pit (49), but topology, and structural details seem to negate it, as does the cladogram.

Conductor origin : (0) sclerotized tegular margin (Figs 10A, 34C, 64C); (1) lightly sclerotized region apical to tegular margin (Figs 75A–C, 77A–C). Most commonly in theridiids, the base of the conductor is merely an extension of the sclerotized tegular margin. In some members of the lost colular setae clade (Theridiinae), however, the conductor originates in a lightly sclerotized apical area of the tegulum.

Subconductor : (0) absent; (1) present. The presence of a tegular outgrowth at the base of the conductor that overlays part of the embolus (Figs 17B, 20C, 24A) is synapomorphic for a group of New World Anelosimus (clade 18). This structure, here termed the subconductor, has sometimes been called the conductor (see e.g. Levi, 1956: plates II, 17, and Coddington, 1990a: fig. 94). The ‘true’ C, however, ultimately arises from the back of it (Figs 17F, G, 91C, D). It could also be a strongly modified conductor base, thus homologous to 68. Chrysso (Fig. 39D, E) has a similar structure, while at the same time having a tegular pit into which the embolus fits. This offers further evidence that the SC, Tp and the latrodectine hollow conductor base are not homologous. Yet homology is possible, and future studies should explore these systems in greater detail.

MA : (0) present (Fig. 75B); (1) absent (Figs 10A, B, 12A). G98-16. In the absence of a detailed comparative survey of palpal homologies at the family level, Coddington (1990a) and Griswold et al. (1998) began by considering the second tegular process as the median apophysis, once the conductor has been accounted for. Although explicit, the authors noted that the criterion is inferior to primary homology conjectures based on similarity criteria. I have found similarity criteria useful in Theridiidae, thus superseding more arbitrary criteria. The theridiid MA is a flexibly attached sclerite originating mesially on the tegulum (Figs 91A, B, D–G, H). In some cases the membrane is so narrow that the MA may appear fused to the tegulum (e.g. Dipoena, Fig. 4A, B), whereas in pimoids, synotaxids and nesticids the fusion is complete (in other words the MA is an outgrowth of the tegulum, Fig. 89A, D, E). The MA contains a loop of the sperm duct in most basal theridiids (Figs 90F, 91B). The theridiid MA is topologically consistent across genera and, when present, interacts with the cymbium to make the BC-lock. The loss of the MA is a synapomorphy of Achaearanea.

MA, sperm duct : (0) loop not inside MA (Fig. 89E); (1) loop inside MA (Figs 90F, 91B). The MA when present in theridiids may contain a loop or SB (SB III) of the sperm duct, here synapomorphic for Theridiidae. Although absent in Eidmanella pallida and Nesticus sylvestrii, some nesticid MAs do contain a loop of the sperm duct (e.g. N. cellulanus, Fig. 89D), and the feature may ultimately optimize at the base of the theridioids. In most basal theridiids the MA contains a loop, but the condition is repeatedly lost, e.g. in clades 27 and 37. In Latrodectus the duct is narrow distally and hard to follow, but probably enters the MA (see e.g. Knoflach & van-Harten, 2002: fig. 22).

MA, tegulum attachment : (0) membranous (Fig. 75B); (1) fused (Fig. 89A, C–E). See characters 71 and 74.

MA, tegular membrane connection : (0) broad; (1) narrow. In basal theridiids the MA base tightly attaches to the tegulum via a narrow membrane. Viewed in an SEM image the MA gives the impression of being a direct outgrowth of the tegulum, with a slightly membranous base (Figs 4B, 31B, 44B). In the Theridiinae, however, the membrane is broader, and the attachment looser, to the centre of the MA. The MA thus appears to lie on top of the tegulum (Figs 13A–C, 75B). The condition in Anelosimus (Fig. 17E) is somewhat intermediate (unsurprising given its phylogenetic position), but the attachment of the membrane is to the centre of the MA, so it is here scored as putatively homologous to the Theridiinae condition.

MA form : (0) unbranched (Fig. 7A, B); (1) two nearly equally sized branches (Fig. 22A, B). Anelosimus rupununi and A. lorenzo are unique in having a basally branched MA.

MA central region : (0) entire (Figs 44A, B, 46A, 52A, 58A, 66A, 71A–C); (1) with a distinct apophysis (Figs 39B, C, 75A–C, 79A, B, D). Several members of the Theridiinae have an apophysis centrally on the MA. It varies in both shape and size, from enormous, e.g. Theridion frondeum (Fig. 75A–C), to quite inconspicuous, e.g. Helvibis (Fig. 49A, C), and can thus be hard to code. Presumably this condition is not homologous to the branched MA, where the MA is split at the base (see previous character). The apophysis is an outgrowth of the central part of the MA, whereas the branching of the MA is basal.

MA apophysis II : (0) absent; (1) present. Theridion frondeum and T. longipedatum (and many other Theridion species) have a second apophysis on the MA (Figs 75B, 77B, C).

MA distal tip : (0) entire (Fig. 28F); (1) hooded (Fig. 34D). Species with a cymbial hook usually have a corresponding hood on the MA tip (Fig. 31F). Although perhaps biologically nonindependent, the two characters show independent variation (they do not have identical distribution); including both, at worst, may add weight to a complex character.

MA hood form : (0) narrow, pit-like (Figs 31F, 34D); (1) scoop-shaped (Figs 60D, 66B, 67D).

TTA : (0) absent (Figs 10A, 12A); (1) present (Fig. 34A−D). G98-18. An additional sclerite beyond the median apophysis and the conductor has been noted in theridiioids and pimoids (Hormiga, 1994a, 2003). In the analysis of Griswold et al. (1998), these features turned out not to be homologous, although further phylogenetic work may show otherwise. In accordance with most previous authors I consider the theridiid locking sclerite to be the MA in all theridiids (see character 71). Coddington (1990a) termed the additional sclerite the theridiid tegular apophysis or TTA. However, data available at the time were sparse, and recent studies of functional aspects of palpal sclerites during copulation (e.g. Knoflach, 1998) and comparative morphology of theridiid palps (pers. observ.) have clarified the issue. Those have revealed that Coddington (1990a) was not consistent in the application of the name. Here I consider the sclerite that locks the palp in the cymbium to be the MA, and TTA is the sclerite that closely associated with the C, E. Both the MA, the TTA are membraneously attached to the tegulum, while the C is always fused to it. A putative homologue of the TTA is present in synotaxids (Figs 1A–C, 88C, see also Agnarsson, 2003c) and on this cladogram the sclerite is a synapomorphy of the synotaxids plus theridioids. The TTA is secondarily lost in Achaearanea, some Theridion (e.g. T. grallator and T. cochise (pers. observ.) and Theridula).

TTA branches : (0) unbranched (normal, Fig. 34B); (1) two branches (Fig. 52D). A basally branched TTA is an autapomorphy of Kochiura rosea on this cladogram. However, it will likely be important to the relationships of Kochiura species.

TTA apex : (0) entire (Fig. 34B); (1) with a small apophysis (Fig. 67A, B). Selkirkiella species usually have a characteristic apical knob (apophysis) centrally on the TTA, apparently a generic synapomorphy.

TTA form : (0) entire (Fig. 34B); (1) grooved (Fig. 44C); (2) excavate (Synotaxus, Fig. 88C).

TTA basal portion : (0) bulky (Fig. 34B); (1) huge, membranous flap (Figs 37B, 67B). The TTA is usually bulky with rather uniform structure. In Cerocida, Phoroncidia and Selkirkiella, however, the basal portion forms an enormous, fairly membranous flap partly engulfing the E.

TTA distal tip : (0) entire (Fig. 7B); (1) hooked (Figs 17A, F, 22D). The distal tip of the TTA in many cases is strongly hooked (not merely bent as in, e.g. Synotaxus, Fig. 1B). The hook, which often has a ridged surface inside it, may play some role in fixing the bulb in the epigynum (see next character).

TTA surface : (0) smooth (Fig. 28A, D); (1) ridged (Fig. 31D). In many species conspicuous ridges are present on the TTA (Figs 7A–C, 15B, 17F, 24B, 31D, 34D, 51D, 54A, 56B, 86A), which, like the hook on the tip, may stabilize or fix the bulb in the epigynum (e.g. Knoflach, 1998).

Embolus and TTA : (0) loosely associated with, or resting in shallow groove on TTA (Fig. 7B); (1) parts of E entirely enclosed in TTA (Figs 37A, B, 44C, 89C). In Thymoites unimaculata (Fig. 85A) the embolus is partly enclosed in a fold of the MA, not the TTA.

Embolus spiral tip : (0) entire (Fig. 7B, C); (1) bifid. The embolic tip in some Anelosimus species is bifid or forked (Figs 17D, E, 20E, 24A).

Embolus origin : (0) retroventral on tegulum (Fig. 17B); (1) retrolateral (ectal), partially or completely hidden by cymbium (Figs 44C, 60A–C, 67B). The E of theridiids originates retroventrally or somewhat retrolaterally on the tegulum, being clearly visible outside the cymbium. In some pholcommatines however, the E origin has shifted to the ectal side of the palp and its base is partially or wholly covered by the cymbial margin. Phoroncidia sp. has an ectal embolus, but the modified cymbium does not hide its base.

Embolus surface : (0) smooth (Fig. 17A–C); (1) ridged (Figs 20F, 31D, 34E).

Embolus shape : (0) short to moderately elongate (Fig. 7B); (1) extremely long, > two spirals (Figs 54D, 73A–C).

Embolus spiral width : (0) thin, much of E spiral subequal to E tip; (1) thick, entire E spiral much broader than tip. The free portion of the embolus (the spiral) is usually narrow and cylindrical (Figs 28B, 62B, 69A–D). In some Anelosimus, the spiral is markedly thick, and only the very tip is cylindrical (Figs 17B, C, 20B, 24A). On this cladogram, this condition is a synapomorphy of clade 17.

Embolus spiral : (0) suboval or round (Fig. 7B); (1) distinctly flattened and with pars pendula. Latrodectus spp. are the only theridiids known to me where the embolus spiral is distinctly flattened for nearly its entire length and clearly divided into a hard embolus and a membranous pars pendula carrying the sperm duct (Fig. 54D).

Embolus form : (0) entire (Fig. 17B); (1) with transverse suture or fracture plane. Although autapomorphic here, the embolus of Achaearanea tepidariorum (and many other Achaearanea species) has a pronounced transverse suture or fracture plane midway along its length (Fig. 10B), see 40.

Embolus distal rim : (0) entire (normal, Fig. 17B); (1) deeply grooved. Nearly the entire distal rim of the emboli of A. rupununi and A. lorenzo is deeply grooved or folded longitudinally (Fig. 22C). The emboli of the sister species A. rupununi and A. lorenzo are nearly identical, and compared to other theridiids, both unusual and highly characteristic. Putatively a source of multiple synapomorphies, here this similarity is conservatively represented in a single character.

Embolic terminus : (0) abrupt (Fig. 7B); (1) with apophysis (EA, Fig. 34E). G98-22. Argyrodes and Ariamnes have a long distal embolic apophysis. Crustulina and some Steatoda have an embolic apophysis that curves towards the embolus, but on this cladogram is not homologous to the argyrodine EA (Fig. 42B–D).

Embolus-tegulum junction : (0) fixed (Fig. 2B); (1) membranous, flexible (Fig. 7B). A membrane lying between the tegulum and the embolic division (ETM) is found in many araneoids, e.g. tetragnathids, araneids (between the tegulum and the radix) and linyphiids (i.e. the linyphiid column) (Hormiga et al., 1995; Griswold et al., 1998). Hormiga et al. (1995) concluded that the linyphiid column was not homologous to the ETM in araneids as it showed independent origin when optimized on their cladogram. Hormiga et al. (1995) overlooked this membrane in the theridiid Steatoda and Griswold et al. (1998) also in Anelosimus, Dipoena and Emertonella. Based on the current analysis, interpretation of the linyphiid column is ambiguous. It may be homologous to the ETM of other araneoids (DELTRAN) or it may be unique (ACCTRAN); the same is true of the ETM within theridiids. As these membranes are quite different, here ACCTRAN is preferred.

Embolic base : (0) entire, smooth (Fig. 4B, C); (1) lobed. The embolic base in many theridiid species is distinctly lobed, but varies in shape, e.g. Anelosimus cf. jucundus (Fig. 20C), Latrodectus (Fig. 54E), Theridion frondeum (Fig. 75B) and Argyrodes (Fig. 31D). Sometimes it provides a locking mechanism between the bulb and parts of the tegulum. The coding treats all lobes as putatively homologous. However, the Theridion +Coleosoma lobe, which locks to the tegular pit, apparently arose independently of other ‘lobes.’ The latter lock system thus seems unique.

Embolic division b : (0) absent; (1) present. The emboli of many Anelosimus have a large, sometimes heavily ridged basal outgrowth (Figs 15D, 20B–D, 24A, 26A, B, 90C) here labelled the embolic division b (Eb, following Levi, 1956,,1963). In A. vittatus the Eb is orientated towards the tibia, rather than the E tip, but presumably this is the same sclerite as labelled Eb in other Anelosimus.

Embolus inserted piece : (0) entire (Fig. 7B); (1) break-off point. Latrodectus spp. have a distal swelling on a part of the embolus tip (Fig. 54D) that marks for a break-off point. During copulation the tip of the embolus breaks off and thus plugs the female genital opening (e.g. Knoflach & van-Harten, 2002).

Extra tegular sclerite : (0) absent (e.g. Fig. 10B); (1) present. The spintharines Episinus (Fig. 46B) and Thwaitesia (Figs 83D, 90G), and some members of the ‘ectal hook clade’ (Figs 60C, 91G) have a tegular sclerite closely associated with the TTA, in addition to the ones present in most theridiids (here labelled simply ‘extra tegular apophysis’, ETA). This cladogram suggests three (ACCTRAN, here preferred) or more (DELTRAN) origins of this sclerite, but given the relatively sparse taxon sampling, the evidence is too weak to justify specific sclerite names.

Lateral eyes (male) : (0) juxtaposed (Fig. 73F); (1) separate. G98-30. Like araneoids in general, theridiids have juxtaposed lateral eyes. Here separated lateral eyes are autapomorphic in Tetragnatha and a synapomorphy of Latrodectus.

Median eyes (male) : (0) flush with carapace (Fig. 19F); (1) alone on tubercle (Argyrodes); (2) eye area raised (all eyes on ‘tubercle’). All argyrodine cephalic regions have modified heads (see below). Argyrodes, Ariamnes, Neospintharus and Rhomphaea have conspicuous tubercles (128, Fig. 30A–D). Median eyes on the tip of a dorsal tubercle is synapomorphic for Argyrodes (Figs 32E, F, 94B); in Phoroncidia (Fig. 62E) and Stemmops (Fig. 73F) the entire eye region is raised.

AME size (male) : (0) subequal or slightly larger than ALE (Figs 14C, 16A); (1) clearly smaller than ALE.

AME-ALE separation (females) : (0) >2 AME diameters; (1) = <2 AME diameters. ALE, AME are widely separated in Tetragnatha and Argiope.

Cheliceral promargin : (0) toothed; (1) smooth. Most araneoids have teeth on the anterior cheliceral margin, and theridiids are no exception (e.g. Figs 19C, 22E, 27F, 29E, 33G, 35H, 41D, 76E, 78F, 80C). A few theridiids lack promarginal teeth, here a synapomorphy of hadrotarsines (Figs 5B, 8E, F) and Latrodectus.

Cheliceral anterior tooth shape : (0) blunt; (1) pointed, sharp. Cheliceral teeth are usually broad basally and taper gradually towards the tip (Fig. 19C). The spintharines Thwaitesia and Episinus have characteristically sharp anterior cheliceral teeth (Figs 47F, 84D). Spintharus, however, has a unique blunt outgrowth whose homology with anterior teeth of other theridiids is unclear (Fig. 70E, F).

Cheliceral anterior tooth number : (0) four or more; (1) three; (2) two; (3) one. A reduction to three anterior teeth is here an ambiguous synapomorphy (DELTRAN) of the spineless femur clade (also in Pimoa). Further reductions take place within Theridiidae, see also character 111.

Cheliceral proximal tooth : (0) = < adjacent tooth; (1) much larger than adjacent tooth. In most theridiids, the first, proximal cheliceral tooth is much larger than the adjacent one (Figs 14B, 15E, 40C, 45J). Here the condition is a synapomorphy of Theridiidae minus Hadrotarsinae, but homoplasy occurs, e.g. in Spintharinae. In Robertus, uniquely, the second tooth is the larger (Fig. 66F).

Cheliceral posterior (retro) margin : (0) toothed; (1) smooth. Most araneoids have some posterior cheliceral teeth and they are more common in theridiids (Figs 19D, 29F, 40D, 45I, 60H, 68B) than the literature would suggest (e.g. Levi & Levi, 1962). Nevertheless, many theridiids lack them (Figs 5F, 8F, 55E, 70F). In this cladogram teeth were apparently lost at the base of Theridiidae (clade 53), but regained in more distal theridiids (clade 43), only to be lost again in clade 14 (Fig. 103). Ameridion is coded as ‘smooth’, although a tiny denticle is present.

Cheliceral posterior tooth number : (0) four or more; (1) three; (2) two; (3) one. Levi & Levi (1962) suggested that, although very variable, the number and shape of cheliceral teeth might be informative. Simple counts are just a first attempt to analyse such variation phylogenetically; homologies are unclear.

Cheliceral furrow : (0) smooth (Fig. 25F); (1) denticulate. In theridiids cheliceral teeth are usually confined to retrolateral and prolateral sides of the fang, while the area directly under the fang (the furrow) is smooth. On this cladogram denticles in the cheliceral furrow are synapomorphic for argyrodines (Fig. 33H), and an autapomorphy of Cerocida strigosa (Fig. 37D).

Cheliceral sexual dimorphism : (0) subequal; (1) male much larger (Tetragnatha, Enoplognatha). G98-33. In Tetragnatha and Enoplognatha the male chelicera are grossly enlarged (Fig. 44I), compared to the female.

Cheliceral ectal surface (male) : (0) smooth; (1) stridulatory. G98-37. Male cheliceral stridulatory ridges are synapomorphic for linyphioids (Wunderlich, 1986; Hormiga, 1994a, b,,2000; Hormiga et al., 1995), although they occur sporadically in other families (e.g. Griswold et al., 1998).

Cheliceral anterior base : (0) evenly rounded (Fig. 5C, D); (1) with a distinct knob (Figs 13F, 41C, 76B, 78G).

Cheliceral apophysis (male) : (0) absent (Fig. 41C); (1) present (Enoplognatha, Fig. 44I).

Cheliceral paturon length : (0) reaching tip of endites, or nearly so (Figs 13F, 60G, 66D); (1) short, not nearly reaching tip of endites. G98-35. Forster et al. (1990) and Griswold et al. (1998) pointed out that hadrostarsid chelicerae are short and do not reach the coxal endites (Fig. 5C). In this cladogram short chelicerae are a synapomorphy of Hadrotarsinae and an autapomorphy of Phoroncidia sp. (Fig. 62E), and Stemmops (Fig. 73G).

Cheliceral paturon width : (0) base wider than palpal coxae and coxae II; (1) base subequal to palpal coxae, narrower than coxae II. Although most theridiids have fairly weak chelicerae compared to typical araneoids, their chelicerae at their widest point (basally) are much wider than the palpal coxae and about as wide, or wider than coxae of leg II (Figs 32E, 50E, 60G, 66D) (coxae I size varies greatly). Hadrotarsines, spintharines and some other theridiids, however, have thin chelicerae where the maximum width only slightly exceeds the palpal coxae and is distinctly less than that of coxae II (Figs 5D, 62E, 84C).

Cheliceral fang length (male) : (0) much shorter than paturon (normal, Fig. 19C, D); (1) huge, nearly as long as paturon (Enoplognatha, Fig. 44I). G98-34.

Cheliceral fang shape : (0) cylindrical (Fig. 19C, D); (1) elongated, sickle-shaped. The classical hadrotarsine fang is long and slender, reaching from the apex of the shortened paturon to the tip of the palpal endites (Forster et al., 1990). Griswold et al. (1998) reported this condition in Emertonella funebris (Fig. 9F, also E. gertschi, Fig. 8E) and Dipoena nigra, and on their cladogram it was a synapomorphy of the hadrotarsines. In some other hadrotarsine genera the fang is even more elongated and flattened (Forster et al., 1990: fig. 392), but in Dipoena nigra it is less so (Fig. 5F). The colulus in Dipoena and the relatively unmodified fang suggest that it is a relatively basal hadrotarsine. On this cladogram the slender cheliceral fang is a synapomorphy of Hadrotarsinae.

Cheliceral hairs : (0) smooth or weakly serrate; (1) strongly serrate and curved. The hairs along the distal, mesial edge of the cheliceral paturon are strongly serrate and curved in Synotaxus, nesticids and hadrotarsine theridiids (Fig. 5B), whereas in other theridiids they are weakly serrate (Figs 27A, F, 68B, 72E). Cerocida strigosa autapomorphically has strongly serrate hairs (Fig. 37D).

Cheliceral boss : (0) present; (1) absent. Griswold et al. (1998; character 39) discussed the distribution of the cheliceral boss in araneoids, but did not include its presence or absence in their analysis (including it yields the same tree, pers. observ.). Here the loss of a cheliceral boss is an ambiguous synapomorphy of the spineless femur clade, being absent in all theridioids (Figs 41C, 66D, 79F, 80B, including Nesticus and Steatoda, contraGriswold et al., 1998), and Synotaxus and Pimoa, but present in Linyphia, Tetragnatha and Argiope.

Carapace texture : (0) smooth (Figs 5D, 27B); (1) rugose, setal bases elevated (Fig. 71D, E); (2) scaly (Fig. 60F, G); (3) rippled (Fig. 38A); (4) bumpy (Fig. 50E, F). Theridiid taxonomic work often refers to carapace (and/or sternum) ‘rugosity’. However, ‘rugosity’ differs between taxa, e.g. Cerocida (Figs 37G, 38A), Helvibis (Fig. 50F), and Pholcomma (Figs 60E, F, 61A, B). Although autapomorphic here, these conditions will probably be generic synapomorphies. Steatoda and Crustulina, synapomorphically, have rugosity caused by the elevation of setal bases (Fig. 71D–F). Most theridiid carapaces are relatively smooth (Fig. 30A–D, but see character 126).

Carapace height (male) : (0) = <0.25–0.5 × length; (1) >0.5 × length (hadrotarsines). Most male, and some female, hadrotarsines have extremely high carapaces (Fig. 5A, cf. Figs 40E, 46F). Here, the high carapace is synapomorphic for Hadrotarsinae.

Carapace coloration : (0) uniform; (1) longitudinal dark band. The usual theridiid carapace colour is fairly uniform. Some species, however, have one or two distinct, dark, longitudinal, central bands (Fig. 94D).

Carapace shape : (0) longer than wide; (1) round, nearly as wide, or wider than long. Hadrotarsines typically have a roundish carapace, hardly longer than wide.

Carapace hairiness : (0) sparsely or patchily hirsute (Figs 40E, F, 48D); (1) uniformly hirsute (Figs 19D, 71D). The latrodectine carapace characteristically is densely hirsute, convergent in derived Anelosimus. The character is coded here from SEM images, hairs may have been lost from some specimens in SEM preparations.

Carapace pars stridens : (0) smooth, or irregular; (1) regular parallel ridges. Various spiders have a prosoma-abdomen stridulation mechanism (for reviews see Legendre, 1963;,Uetz & Stratton, 1982). Typically, pairs of elevated setal bases, here called stridulatory picks (SP; the term plectrum refers to such stridulatory parts in general) bordering the pedicel on the abdomen (Figs 11A, 16B, C) interact with ridges on the posterior margin of the carapace (pars stridens) (Fig. 10D, E). Although underreported, this mechanism is widespread and characteristic of theridiids. In several species with distinct abdominal SPR, no regular pars stridens ridges are present (e.g. AnelosimusFig. 21D, E, and ChryssoFig. 40E, F), similar to species lacking SPR (e.g. Phoroncidia, Fig. 62G, and outgroups). Presumably, the rubbing of the SPR against patches of irregularly rugose surface nonetheless produces stridulation. More commonly, clearly parallel regular ridges are present (Figs 1D, E, 32A, 41F, 42G, 44H, 49F, 57A, 58D, 60F, 64E, 66G, 67G, 71F, 75D, 79E, 87B) here a synapomorphy of clade 43, but quite homoplasious. Like the abdominal stridulatory picks, the prosomal ridges are nearly always much less developed in females, than in males (compare G and H in Fig. 42, and F and G in Fig. 71), supporting their role in male courtship.

Pars stridens : (0) separate (two patches, Fig. 71F); (1) continuous (Figs 36G, 60F). In taxa with regular pars stridens lateral to the pedicel, the two patches may be completely separate or interconnected with one another.

Interocular area : (0) more or less flush with clypeus (Figs 60G, 66D); (1) projecting beyond clypeus. The eye regions of argyrodine genera (Argyrodes, Ariamnes, Neospintharus and Rhomphaea, clade 31) project markedly beyond the clypeus (Figs 30A, C, D, 34F, 94A, B, D, E), in contrast to Faiditus (Figs 30B, 94C).

Clypeus : (0) concave or flat (Figs 60G, 66D, 76B); (1) with a prominent projection. The argyrodines Argyrodes, Faiditus and Neospintharus have a markedly projecting clypeus (Figs 30A, B, D, 94B, C, E); Carniella (Fig. 36E, F), and some other pholcommatines, are similar.

Ocular and clypeal region setae distribution (male): (0) sparse (Figs 60G, 76B); (1) in a dense field, or fields. Argyrodines (Figs 30A–D, 34F, 48C), and Carniella (Fig. 36E, F) have a dense field of hairs, often modified, on the eye and/or clypeal projections.

Clypeal setae morphology (male clypeal glands) : (0) as other setae (Fig. 76B); (1) thick and strongly serrate. In many argyrodines, hairs on cephalic modifications are strongly modified to be both thick and deeply serrate. The cephalic modifications and the modified hairs reportedly indicate the presence of clypeal glands (Lopez et al. 1980;,Lopez & Emerit, 1981;,Whitehouse, 1987a; Juberthie & Lopez, 1993). Such hairs occur in Ariamnes cf. attenuatus, Neospintharus trigonum and Rhomphaea metaltissima (Figs 30C, D, 34F), but were apparently broken off in both Argyrodes species (A. elevatus, Fig. 30A), where their presence is indicated by broad setal bases (alternatively they may be absent in these two). However, they are apparently absent in Faiditus cf. chickeringi (Fig. 30B). All Argyrodes species studied in detail have both glands and modified hairs (Legendre & Lopez, 1974,,1975;,Lopez & Emerit, 1981;,Whitehouse, 1987a; Juberthie & Lopez, 1993) and most likely all argyrodines have clypeal glands. Whitehouse (1987a) showed that the accurate detection of clypeal glands may depend on how animals are prepared for SEM. Carniella (Fig. 36E, F) also has a dense field of setae on a clypeal modification, although they do not appear strongly modified, and whether they are glandular or not is unknown.

Labium distal margin : (0) rebordered; (1) not swollen distally. The presence or absence of a rebordered labium (distinctly swollen distal labial edge) is a classical character featured in most family level identification keys to spiders, and characteristic of many araneoids (see e.g. Kaston, 1978, 1981; Dippenaar-Schoeman & Jocqué, 1997). Theridiidae and Synotaxus, however, lack a rebordered labium (Fig. 27C, also e.g. Levi & Levi, 1962). The optimization of an unswollen labial edge is here ambiguous. It could be a synapomorphy of theridioids, secondarily rebordered in nesticids (ACCTRAN), or a synapomorphy of Synotaxus on the one hand and Theridiidae on the other (DELTRAN). As the rebordering of the nesticid labium is typical, here the latter optimization is preferred.

Labium-sternum connection : (0) visible seam (Figs 27C, 68A, 72F); (1) fused (Fig. 61A). A distinct seam is sometimes present between the sternum and the labium. Although much used in keys and taxonomy (e.g. Kaston, 1978, 1981), the presence or absence of a seam is extremely homoplasious within theridiids (CI = 0.07) and thus of limited usefulness at higher systematic levels. Here a fused connection is, for example, an ambiguous synapomorphy of Theridiinae (ACCTRAN), but is certainly not characteristic of the clade (see Fig. 104).

Labium shape : (0) subrectangular (Fig. 21B); (1) triangular (Fig. 5A). Dipoena, Emertonella and Euryopis have a distinctly triangular labium. This hadrotarsine synapomorphy is also present in at least Gmogala sp. and Hadrotarsus sp. (pers. observ.).

Sternum shape : (0) elongated, longer than wide; (1) subequal or wider than long.

Sternocoxal tubercles : (0) present; (1) absent. Some araneoids have prominent sternal tubercules opposed to the coxae (e.g. Nephila, M. Kuntner pers. comm.). Here such tubercles are as synapomorphy of Argyrodinae, but reversed in Ariamnes.

Sternum setal bases : (0) unmodified, like other setal bases; (1) raised. As on the carapace (character 123), the setal bases of the sternum of Steatoda and Crustulina are elevated. It is unclear whether the two are independent, but the removal of either has no effect on tree topology.

Pedicel location : (0) anterior (Fig. 94A–D); (1) medial (Figs 43A, C, 94J, K, 97F). The classical description of theridiid abdomens, is ‘higher than long’ (e.g. Achaearanea) vs. the more common ‘longer than high’ (Levi & Levi, 1962). This nomenclature implies a difference in abdomen shape that may not exist. Instead the abdomens of Achaearanea and several other taxa appear ‘high’ because the pedicel inserts closer to the middle of the abdominal venter, rather than closer to its anterior apex. This means that the pedicel inserts relatively close to the epigynum (Fig. 43C). This distinction also clarifies the coding of the relative position of the spinnerets (character 203).

Pedicel lyriform organs : (0) narrow; (1) broad. Most, if not all, spiders (and perhaps other arachnids with a pedicel) have rows of slit sensilla (lyriform organs) on either side of the lorum of the pedicel (Fig. 53G, H) (e.g. Barth & Libera, 1970;,Lopez & Juberthie, 1996). Usually the row is fairly uniform in width (Fig. 67H), but in the argyrodines Ariamnes, Rhomphaea and Neospintharus (clade 29) the row is notably broad in the middle so that the central slits are several times wider than those at either end (Fig. 34H).

Abdominal shape : (0) with paired humps (Fig. 57E); (1) ellipsoid, smooth (Fig. 43A).

Abdominal colour pattern (in alcohol) : (0) folium or similar pattern; (1) uniform (e.g. tan) or unpigmented. The pigmentation pattern on the abdomen is very variable in theridiids (Figs 94A–J, 95E, 96A, B, 97A–F, 99D–F) and it is hard to separate the variation into discrete character states. Regardless of coloration, a folium can be either present (Fig. 94B–E, G–J) or absent, leaving a uniform tan, grey or nonpigmented abdomen (Fig. 94A, F).

Abdominal folium pattern : (0) bilateral spots or blotches (Figs 94B, C, 96B); (1) distinct central band. In those taxa where a folium is present, it sometimes forms a distinct band down the centre dorsally (Figs 94G–J, 99E, F).

Dorsal band : (0) dark with white edging (Kochiura, Anelosimus, Figs 94G, J, 99F); (1) light with dark edging (Fig. 94H); (2) Ameridion, light with white edging (Fig. 94I).

Abdominal dot, pigment : (0) silver; (1) nonreflective, dull. Amongst theridiids, distinctly silvery pigment occurs in argyrodines and Thwaitesia (Fig. 97E).

Abdominal pedicel area (male) : (0) smooth; (1) sclerotized. The pedicel area on the male abdomen usually bears stridulatory setae; it is often sclerotized compared to abdominal cuticles elsewhere (Fig. 77F) and sometimes the sclerotization completely surrounds the pedicel.

Abdominal pedicel area sclerotization : (0) continuous; (1) separate (two patches).

Abdominal suprapedicellate nubbins : (0) absent (Fig. 62F); (1) present (Figs 81E–G, 87A). Suprapedicellate nubbins (presumably stridulatory) occur in all araneoid taxa I examined, apart from Phoroncidia (Fig. 62F, see Discussion); it is probably an araneoid synapomorphy. In theridiids these nubbins are between and around the stridulatory picks (Figs 4F, 10F, 11A, 14A, 24D, E, 26D, E, 47A, 48E). Although uninformative here, the character may be informative at some deeper level. Nubbins often surround the pedicel (Figs 47B, 53G, H, 77D)

Stridulatory pick row (SPR) : (0) absent (Fig. 4F); (1) present (Figs 16B, C, 21A, 24D, E). In addition to abdominal nubbins, many theridiids have, in the same region, modified (raised) setal bases (Fig. 51G) that appear to be stridulatory picks (Figs 16B, C, 21A, 24D, E, 29C, D, 51E, F, 52E, F). Although commonly present in both sexes, they are usually much reduced in the female (cf. Fig. 18B and Fig. 18C) and likely play a role in male courtship. Stridulatory ‘ridges’ on the male abdomen have been known in a few theridiids, but picks appear to be nearly universal within the family, although absent in many hadrotarsines (Fig. 4F), as well as in Phoroncidia (Fig. 62F), and Cerocida (Fig. 38E). The picks range from distinct and obvious to very slightly modified setae (e.g. Latrodectus, Fig. 54F). Hadrotarsines occasionally have modified setae that may be intermediate, as their phylogenetic position implies. Spintharines (Fig. 47A) have weak picks, here interpreted as homologous. The feature is thus sometimes difficult to code unambiguously, and further work is required to resolve the issue. In a typical SPR the most dorsal pair orients mesially and the remainder ectally. The mesially orientated picks have been lost (or inverted) several times, but the ectally orientated picks are absent only in Selkirkiella.

SPR form : (0) weakly keeled (Figs 67F, 74F); (1) strongly keeled and elongate (Figs 16B, C, 24D, E, 42F).

SPR pick number : (0) three or less; (1) four or more.

SPR ectally orientated picks : (0) present; (1) absent. All but the most dorsal pick setae usually face ectally (outwards, Fig. 24E). These are absent in Selkirkiella, leaving only the most dorsal, mesially orientated pick (Fig. 67F).

SPR insertion : (0) flush with abdominal surface (Fig. 18D); (1) on a ridge (Figs 32D, 41E, 44G, 72A, B). The picks sometimes insert on a conspicuous ridge above the pedicel.

SPR region : (0) irregular (Fig. 24D, E); (1) parallel ridges. In Selkirkiella, the abdominal stridulatory region has parallel ridges, resembling those on the carapace (Fig. 67F).

SPR mesially orientated picks : (0) absent (Fig. 32C, D); (1) present (Figs 24E, 29D).

SPR mesially orientated picks relative to sagittal plane : (0) angled dorsally (Fig. 52E, F); (1) perpendicular or angled ventrally. Usually the uppermost picks point slightly dorsally. In some Anelosimus (clade 18) they picks are almost exactly perpendicular or angled downwards relative to the sagittal axis of the body (Figs 18B, D, 21A, 24D, E).

SPR setal bases : (0) low, gently ridged (Fig. 24E); (1) acute, almost pointed. Picks in Ameridion and Theridula are sharply pointed, almost tooth-like (Fig. 81F).

SPR : (0) straight or slightly irregular (Fig. 52E, F); (1) distinctly curved; (2) dorsal picks set apart from others. The row of picks in several Anelosimus species (clade 20) is distinctly curved (Figs, 18B, 24D). In some argyrodines the two dorsalmost picks are set apart from the rest (Fig. 32C, D).

SPR dorsal pick spacing : (0) subequal to ventral pick spacing (Figs 76A, 85C, D); (1) distinctly compressed (Fig. 16B). Within Anelosimus (clade, 18) the dorsal stridulatory picks are distinctly compressed (Fig. 16B).

SPR relative to pedicel : (0) lateral (Figs 32C, 58C); (1) dorsal (Figs 34D, 36H, 49D, E).

Additional stridulatory picks : (0) absent (Fig. 24D, E); (1) present. The SPR are parallel files lateral or dorsal to the pedicel. In some cases additional setae are found outside this file (Figs 10F, 76A, 77E).

Suprapedicellate dorsal (11 o'clock) proprioreceptor : (0) absent (Fig. 38E); (1) present (Figs, 18D, 32C). Proprioreceptor setae are present on the appendages of many spiders (Seyfarth, 1985; Barth, 2001). The proprioreceptors are socketed and innervated macrosetae that document the relative position of the appendage (or joint) bearing them. As a joint is flexed, such setae, appropriately positioned, are pressed against a nearby substrate, and this mechanical flexion feeds the nervous system accurate positional information. Theridiids and many other spiders (pers. observ.) have a series of long, flexible, abdominal setae situated around the pedicel, with their fine tips touching the carapace from various directions (Figs 43A, B, 53C). When the abdomen moves relative to the carapace, these hairs will, inevitably, be flexed or extended as they press against the carapace. Although information on the innervation of these setae is lacking, a proprioreceptive function seems an obvious interpretation. Their presence on spider abdomens is here reported for the first time (but see Foelix, 1996: fig. 206 and legend). Interestingly, Juberthie & Lopez (1994) suggest a similar function for the setae of the SPR. In the taxa examined here, theridioids are unusual in often having relatively many pairs, and in particular a pair of proprioreceptors dorsal (11 o'clock) to the pedicel, while in other taxa the proprioreceptors are placed mostly lateral to dorsolateral. It should be noted that these setae are quite variable and often hard to see unless in excellent SEM preps. This is a preliminary and speculative effort to include a part of the variation of this complicated character system.

Suprapedicellate ventrolateral (4 o'clock) proprioreceptor : (0) absent; (1) present (Fig. 18D). In most taxa examined here, setal proprioceptors are present along the entire side of the pedicel, from ventrolateral, to dorsolateral. In most argyrodines and a few other taxa proprioreceptors are restricted to the dorsolateral and dorsal side of the pedicel, thus ventrolateral proprioceptors are lacking (Fig. 64D).

Abdominal suprapedicellate apodemes : (0) distinctly disk-like, strongly rugose; (1) inconspicuous, weakly rugose or smooth (Figs 4F, 24D, 47A). In many araneoids, abdominal apodemes are distinct, disk-like and rugose. Typically, in theridiids they are inconspicuous, or if sclerotized, their surface is relatively smooth.

Abdominal surface : (0) smooth; (1) with scuta. G98-47. Here only Pholcomma hirsutum has abdominal scuta. However, other pholcommatines also have scuta, and the character may be important for pholcommatine relationships.

Sigilla : (0) conspicuous, deep, contrastingly coloured; (1) inconspicuous, superficial, unicolourous. The abdomen typically bears two to several pairs of dorsal small depressions (sigilla) in longitudinal rows. In most theridiids these sigilla are inconspicuous, but in others the depression is distinct and coloured, usually reddish (see Roberts, 1985: plates 103–127).

Epiandrous gland spigots (fusules) : (0) present (e.g. Figs 3A–E, 21F, 32G, 44F, 56F, 62H, 86C); (1) absent (Figs 7D, 37F, 69F). Epiandrous glands and associated spigots are restricted to male spiders. They are immediately anterior to the genital furrow and are presumably exclusively used to make the sperm web (or part of it). Epiandrous gland spigots seem to be present, albeit sporadically, in most spider lineages (Marples, 1967; Lopez & Emerit, 1988), including liphistiids (Legendre & Lopez, 1981) making them a potential synapomorphy of spiders. Erigonines seem to lack epiandrous fusules and it has been hypothesized to be one of the synapomorphies of this linyphiid subfamily (Hormiga, 2002; J. Miller, pers. comm.), and they are absent sporadically in theridiids.

Epiandrous spigot arrangement : (0) in one pair of sockets (Fig. 44F); (1) in a row (Fig. 3B–E). In many orbicularians the epiandrous gland spigots are arranged in irregular transverse rows along the male genital plate (Fig. 3B–E). In, others, e.g. Tetragnatha extensa (Fig. 3A), the pimoid Weintrauboa (Hormiga, 2003), and many basal theridiids, however, the spigots are tightly arranged in two patches, usually in clear depressed sockets (Figs 4G, 24F, 28G, 44F, 48G, 53D, 72C, 74H). Here, where ACCTRAN optimization is selected, socketed epiandrous spigots are interpreted as synapomorphic for theridiids, with three reversals. A reversal to spigots in rows defines latrodectines (Fig. 55F); with additional homoplasy in Steatoda (Fig. 72C) it is autapomorphic in Ariamnes and is a synapomorphy for Theridiinae (Figs 49G, 58E, 79G, 82A, 85E). Many theridiines are somewhat intermediate (e.g. Figs 14G, 40A) in that rows are not continuous (a cap in the centre); nevertheless, in these cases individual spigots are still separate (Fig. 40A), rather than tightly grouped (as e.g. in Figs 15F, 19A), and no distinct depression (socket) surrounds them.

Epiandrous gland spigot pair number : (0) >10 (Fig. 3B–D); (1) < 8 (Fig. 4G). Theridioids have comparatively few pairs of fusules, usually eight or fewer, with some reversals to ten or more within Theridiidae. Considerable intraspecific and intrageneric variation has been reported in fusule numbers of some families (e.g. Marples, 1967; Hormiga, 2002, 2003). Intrageneric (Figs 14F, G, 83F, G), and intraspecific variation is also found in theridiids, and some show asymmetric variation as well (Fig. 24F). Here, such variation was not extensively assessed, as accurate counts require SEM; the coding in some cases (based on a single specimen) may thus be somewhat artefactual.

Male seminal vesicula : (0) small; (1) large and darkened. Knoflach (1998) found that a group of closely related Theridion (including the type species T. pictum) have large and darkened seminal vesicles compared to other theridiids she studied.

Colulus : (0) present (Figs 45E, 61F, 74C); (1) absent (Figs 16E, 78A); (2) invaginated (Figs 9D, 63G). G98-65, in part. The colulus is generally considered homologous to the cribellum (e.g. Griswold et al., 1998 and references therein). It has been lost frequently in araneoids. Here the loss of a colulus is synapomorphic for Anelosimus plus theridiines (clade 25, termed the lost colulus clade). However, a strongly invaginated colular area is a synapomorphy of Emertonella plus Euryopis and autapomorphy of Phoroncidia (Fig. 109).

Colulus size : (0) large and fleshy (Figs 55H, 61F); (1) small, less than half the length of its setae (Fig. 38B). G98-65, in part. The araneoid colulus is usually large and fleshy, but Griswold et al. (1998; character 65) reconstructed it as reduced or absent in several lineages. Griswold et al. (1998) scored only the size of the colulus, where small included absence, and found a ‘reduced’ colulus uniting Anelosimus and the hadrotarsines in their cladogram. However, I view the states of these taxa as nonhomologous; the colulus in Dipoena nigra, as in many other Dipoena, is certainly larger than half of the length of its setae and a colulus is absent in Anelosimus. Here, instead, a small colulus occurs in spintharines, Cerocida strigosa and Kochiura (Fig. 109).

Colular setae : (0) present; (1) absent. The colulus usually bears some setae, including a distinctive median pair of long setae (Fig. 55H). Even when the colulus is absent this pair of setae often persists (Figs 25E, 63G). Levi & Levi (1962) termed this condition ‘colulus replaced by two setae’, a misnomer because if the colulus is present, the setae are also. These setae are lost distally in the lost colulus clade, a theridiine synapomorphy, and autapomorphically in Euryopis gertschi (Fig. 109).

Colular setae number (female) : (0) three or more (Fig. 55H); (1) two (Figs 16E, 38B, 45E). Crustulina, Latrodectus and Steatoda females have three or sometimes more setae, males sometimes only two. Here, the loss of setae other than the central pair is a synapomorphy of the theridioid clade, with a reversal to additional colular setae synapomorphic for Latrodectinae (Fig. 109).

Palpal claw (female) : (0) present (e.g. Fig. 16G); (1) absent (Fig. 63I). G98-53. The absence of a palpal claw here is autapomorphic for Phoroncidia (Fig. 63I). However, many hadrotarsines and possibly other Phoroncidia species also lack female palpal tarsal claws.

Palpal claw form (female) : (0) attenuate (Figs 16G, 47E58G); (1) palmate; (2) semipalmate. G98-54. Hadrotarsines have flattened, distally broadened (palmate) female palpal claws (Fig. 9E, see also Hickman, 1943; Wunderlich, 1978; Forster et al., 1990; Griswold et al., 1998). A somewhat similar claw occurs in other theridiid genera (Figs 11D, 87E), here termed semipalmate. The semipalmate claw is distinctly curved and has a strong row of subequally sized denticles. However, it is not flattened as in the hadrotarsines. Here the palmate palpal claw occurs in Hadrotarsinae and the semipalmate claw in Achaearanea and Tidarren.

Palpal claw dentition (female) : (0) dense, > half of surface covered by denticles (Figs 2D, 9E, 11D, 12G, 45G, 47E, 58G, 76D, 80D); (1) sparse, <half of surface covered by denticles (Fig. 57D).

Palpal tibial dorsal trichobothria (female) : (0) numerous, more than six; (1) three to five; (2) one to two (Fig. 74D).

Palpal tarsal setae (female) : (0) smooth; (1) serrated (Figs 9E, 43E).

Palpal tarsus dorsal setae (female) : (0) present; (1) absent (Fig. 43E). Theridiids and relatives have relatively asetose appendages (see 183; Griswold et al., 1998). J. Miller (pers. comm.) found the distribution of dorsal tarsal macrosetae to be informative for erigonine phylogeny; here the absence of dorsal macrosetae on the female palpal tarsus is a synapomorphy of the spineless femur clade.

Femur I relative to II : (0) subequal; (1) robust, clearly larger than femur II.

Femoral macrosetae : (0) present; (1) absent (Fig. 63F). G98-59. Socketed macrosetae are found on the femora of most spiders. Wunderlich (1986) pointed out that the theridioid (nesticid-theridiid) lineage lacked them. Griswold et al. (1998) found them absent in cyatholipoids (synotaxids plus cyatholipids) as well, thus constituting the spineless femur clade. The present study corroborates this pattern.

Leg IV relative length (male) : (0) 3rd longest (typical leg formula 1243); (1) 2nd longest (typical leg formula 1423); (2) longest (typical leg formula 4123). Relative araneoid leg length varies considerably. Leg I is usually the longest, followed either by legs IV or II; leg III is always the shortest. Here leg IV longer than II is primitive for theridiids. However, in some argyrodines, Kochiura, and Anelosimus, leg IV is shorter than II, and in Euryopis leg IV is the longest.

Leg IV relative length (female) : (0) 3rd longest; (1) 2nd longest; (2) longest. The phylogenetic distribution of leg lengths differs between males and females.

Femur vs. metatarsus length (leg I) : (0) metatarsus longer; (1) metatarsus shorter (Fig. 63F).

Metatarsus vs. tibia length (leg I) : (0) metatarsus longer; (1) metatarsus shorter (Fig. 63F). On this cladogram an elongated metatarsus is a synapomorphy of clade 4. Synotaxus also has very long metatarsi (Fig. 95D), but other leg segments are equally elongated.

Metatarsal ventral macrosetae : (0) like other macrosetae; (1) thickened ventrally. Several Anelosimus have a row of notably thick macrosetae ventrally on the metatarsus (Fig. 26F). The condition is polymorphic for at least A. studiosus.

Metatarsus I trichobothrium position : (0) proximal (0.3–0.45); (1) distal (0.55–0.7); (2) submedian (0.46–0.54).

Metatarsus III trichobothrium : (0) present; (1) absent.

Metatarsus IV trichobothrium : (0) absent; (1) present.

Patella−tibia autospasy : (0) absent; (1) present. G98-60. Among araneoids coxa−trochanter autospasy is the norm and patella−tibia autospasy is synapomorphic for linyphioids (Wunderlich, 1986; Hormiga, 1994b; character 55).

Tarsus IV ventral setae (comb) : (0) smooth; (1) serrated (theridioid tarsal comb). G98-62. A row of stronger, curved serrated setae on tarsus IV is a classic theridiid character (Figs 59A, B, 76C). Some serrated bristles are also present in nesticids and Synotaxus. Here the feature is synapomorphic for the spineless femur clade. Allegedly, some Pholcomma and several argyrodines lack the comb (Kaston, 1981; Levi & Levi, 1962; Roth, 1993, etc.), but this is incorrect (Figs 25E, F, 32H, 57F), although the comb's presence may not be detected in light microscopy.

Tarsus IV ventral setal surface : (0) smooth; (1) theridiid grooves. In most theridiids the tarsal comb setae are distinctly curved with deep parallel longitudinal grooves (Fig. 11E, F), features absent in other families, and in Hadrotarsinae (Fig. 6A). In some rare or very small species I have not been able to verify the grooves (e.g. Carniella, Phoroncidia).

Tarsus IV comb serrations : (0) simple, straight; (1) curved hooks. Tarsal comb bristle morphology varies greatly. Synotaxus, nesticids and various theridiids have simple straight bristles (Figs 5G, 6A, 8B, 14E, 16F, 19E, 23E, F, 63E), while in others the serrations form curved hooks (Figs 11E, F, 12F, 35E–G, 59A, B, 78E, 80E, 84E).

Tarsus IV comb bristle dorsal margin : (0) straight; (1) distinctly notched. Spintharines have peculiar tarsal comb bristles. Viewed dorsally, the distal part is somewhat ladderlike, having distinct acute dorsal notches, particularly at the very tip (Figs 47D, 70D, 84E; compare to Achaearanea, Fig. 11F).

Tarsus I ventral setae : (0) ungrouped; (1) grouped, flat-tipped (Figs 6B, C, 8C, D). Hadrotarsines synapomorphically have grouped, flat-tipped setae on tarsus I (Figs 6B, C, 8C, D, see also Levi, 1968:,fig. 9; Wunderlich, 1978: fig. 3; Forster et al., 1990). The first tarsi of at least some theridiids also have similarly modified setae (Figs 26G, 84F), possibly homologous to those in hadrotarsines. Regardless, tightly grouped modified setae, at least, are a hadrotarsine synapomorphy. Further work is clearly needed to understand the distribution and function of the various setal types on theridiid legs.

Tarsal organ size : (0) smaller than setal sockets (normal); (1) enlarged. The typical araneoid tarsal organ (all legs and palpi) is about the size of a macrosetal or trichobothrial socket, with the opening clearly smaller than the width of adjacent setae (Figs 1D, 43E). Some theridiids (clade 46) have enlarged tarsal organs in which the circumference is equal to or larger than adjacent setal sockets, and the opening is as large or larger than those of setal or trichobothrial sockets (Figs 11C, 27G, 33F).

Tarsus IV central claw vs. laterals (male) : (0) short, at most subequal (Figs 66E, 72D); (1) elongate, longer (Figs 19E, 21C, 23D, 32H, 57F, 58F). The middle tarsal claw of all argyrodines is notably long in both sexes (Exline & Levi, 1962). In most male theridiids the central claw is relatively longer than in females and here the central claw longer than laterals is a synapomorphy for clade 33.

Tarsus IV central claw vs. laterals (female) : (0) equal or shorter; (1) stout and distinctly longer; (2) minute. G98-63. In argyrodines the fourth tarsal female (and male) claw is stout and long. It is also set as high on the tarsal tip as the lateral claws (Figs 32H, 57F), whereas normally the central claw inserts much lower than the lateral claws (e.g. Figs 21C, 37E, 45H, 55B). In the hadrotarsines and some other theridiids the central claw (in both sexes) is minute, being less than half the length of the laterals (Figs 8B, C, 74E).

Spinneret insertion : (0) abdominal apex (Figs 43A, 94F, J); (1) subapical, abdomen extending beyond spinnerets. Although the shift of the theridiid pedicel posteriorly on the abdominal venter (character 140) causes the abdomen to appear to extend beyond the spinnerets (Fig. 94J) this does represent a change in abdomen shape or spinneret insertion position. However, in some taxa the spinneret insertion has moved anteriorly (or the abdomen extended posteriorly; Figs 94A–E, 98F), regardless of the position of the pedicel.

Spinneret sclerotized ring : (0) absent (Fig. 43A); (1) present (Figs 63B, 74A). Phoroncidia and Stemmops have an elevated, sclerotized, ridge around the spinneret area.

ALS median surface : (0) like ectal surface (Figs 59C, 78D, 85G); (1) with parallel ridges (Fig. 7F). G98-67. All studied Hadrotarsus (and some other hadrotarsines) have series of apparently stridulatory parallel ridges on the ALS median surface (e.g. Forster et al., 1990). Although considered a hadrotarsine synapomorphy by Griswold et al. (1998), their distribution is not so simple. Here, only Euryopis gertschi and Emertonella funebris (clade 51) have these ridges (Figs 7F, 9B). Dipoena nigra does not (Fig. 6D, contraGriswold et al., 1998), and nor do D. torva, D. cf. hortoni, or Gmogala sp. The supposedly distantly related Chilenodes (Malkaridae: Palpimanoidea, but see Schütt, 2000,,2002) have similar ridges (Platnick & Forster, 1987).

ALS piriform (PI) spigot bases : (0) normal; (1) reduced. G98-69. As in other members of Griswold et al. 's (1998) ‘reduced piriform clade’, all theridiids have short piriform bases (e.g.Figs 39F, 59D).

ALS piriform field size : (0) large (over 40 spigots); (1) small (less than 35 spigots). The piriform field of some araneoids, e.g. Argiope argentata (Griswold et al., 1998: fig. 48B) is large, containing numerous spigots. In theridiids (e.g. Figs 6D, 7F, 23C, 25B, 35B, 36I, 38C, 78C) and Synotaxus (Fig. 1E), however, the piriform spinning field is typically reduced. However, as the number of piriform spigots varies continuously, it is hard to reduce observations to homology statements. Some theridiids, e.g. Achaearanea, Tidarren and Enoplognatha (Figs 45D, 87C) do have a piriform field of 40 spigots or more. Others, such as Latrodectus (Fig. 55C) have approximately 35. For the taxa included here, 35 spigots is a convenient, although arbitrary, limit.

PLS flagelliform spigot length : (0) subequal to PLS CY; (1) longer than PLS CY (Figs 68E, 78B, 82D, 87D).

PLS post CY base : (0) normal; (1) enlarged. G98-75. The PLS posterior and mesial CY spigots are usually about the same size (e.g. Fig. 11B), but in a few taxa the former is obviously larger and longer (Coddington, 1989; Hormiga, 1993, 1994a, b; Hormiga et al., 1995). Hormiga (1994a; character 58, fig. 146) and Griswold et al. (1998) showed that the enlarged state is a synapomorphy of linyphioids, convergently present in some symphytognathoid taxa as well.

PLS, PMS CY spigot bases : (0) not modified, subequal or smaller than ampullates (Fig. 11B); (1) huge and elongated, much larger than ampullates. All the argyrodine genera have distinctively shaped, grossly enlarged CY spigot bases (Figs 33B, 35A, 57C, 65C), here an unambiguous argyrodine synapomorphy.

CY shaft surface : (0) smooth (Figs 38D, 43G); (1) grooved. The argyrodine CY shaft is distinctly ridged (Figs 33B, 35A, 57C, 65C).

PLS CY spigot number : (0) two (Fig. 11B); (1) one. G98-74. Cerocida strigosa apparently has only one PLS CY (Fig. 38D). Although autapomorphic here, it may be an important feature of future work on Cerocida or Pholcommatinae.

PLS AC spigot number : (0) five or more (Fig. 29B); (1) four or less (Fig. 8A). The plesiomorphic araneoid PLS has numerous AC spigots, but the number has been reduced repeatedly, e.g. in pimoids (Hormiga, 1994a: character 60), nesticids, within hadrotarsines (Euryopis, Figs 8A, 9B), and within the Pholcommatinae (e.g. Pholcomma, Fig. 61E). Most taxa with a reduced field have one to three AC, but Phoroncidia has four (Fig. 63C, D).

PLS flagelliform spigot : (0) present (Fig. 11B); (1) absent. G98-77. The loss of PLS flagelliform (FL) gland spigot is a hadrotarsine synapomorphy (Dipoena nigra, Fig. 6D, F;D. torva, Fig. 6E; Euryopis, Figs 8A, 9C; Gmogala sp., pers. observ.; Hadrotarsus sp., pers. observ.). Thwaitesia (Fig. 84A, B) and basal argyrodines (Argyrodes, Fig. 33B; Faiditus, Fig. 48F; Neospintharus, Fig. 57C) also lack the FL. Spigot loss should track gland loss. Kovoor & Lopez (1983) found no flagelliform glands in Argyrodes argyrodes, Rhomphaea or Ariamnes. The latter two do have just two of the triplet spigots, but morphology clearly suggests that an aggregate, not an FL, is lost (Figs 35A, 65A, C). This interpretation requires the regaining of the FL spigot in Rhomphaea or Ariamnes (Fig. 103). Although the histological interpretation is more parsimonious, it would be inconsistent to code an apparent flagelliform spigot as an aggregate. Histology and morphology conflict here and only further research can resolve it.

PLS AG spigot number (female) : (0) two (Fig. 11B); (1) one. The argyrodine genera Ariamnes (Fig. 35A) and Rhomphaea (Fig. 65C) share the loss of one of the two AG spigots in the female (clade 28, note that male Dipoena nigra may have only one, Fig. 6F). Forster et al. (1990: 97) indicate the absence of AG also in Neospintharus trigonum (their fig. 358). However, what they have illustrated resembles a Rhomphaea much more than N. trigonum (cf. Fig. 57C). Achaearanea wau (Fig. 12D) also appears to have only a single AG; the condition in its sister species A. vervoorti is unknown.

PLS AG spigot size : (0) circumference at base subequal to or less than CY; (1) circumference at base distinctly greater than CY (Fig. 11B). G98-78. The enlarged and modified PLS AG spigots in theridiids and nesticids were pointed out by Coddington (1989) and stressed by Forster et al. (1990). Griswold et al. (1998) scored Pimoa as having normal AG. However, if ‘huge’ means ‘… the diameter of … AG spigots is much greater than any other spigot elsewhere on the spinneret’ (Griswold et al., 1998: 42), then Pimoa does indeed have enlarged AG spigots (Hormiga, 1994a: e.g. fig. 83); the other pimoid genus, Weintrauboa, however, does not (Hormiga, 2003). Here enlarged AGs are an ambiguous synapomorphy of clade 59 (ACCTRAN), convergent in reversed Linyphia.

PLS anterior AG spigot shape : (0) normal, round; (1) flattened. Theridiids have distinctly flattened anterior AG shafts (Figs 7F, G, 8A, 9A–C, 11B, 12D, 25C, 43G, 53B, 74J, 78B, 87D instead of the more typical round shape (Fig. 1F). Dipoena nigra males have one very slightly flattened AG (Fig. 6F), likely also in females.

PLS posterior AG spigot shape : (0) round; (1) flattened (Fig. 11B). In contrast to most theridiids, only one of the two AGs is flattened in Cerocida (Fig. 38D), Pholcomma (Fig. 61C–E), Robertus (Fig. 66H), Selkirkiella (Fig. 68E), and probably D. nigra (Fig. 6D). The posterior AG is unmodified (and only slightly modified in Enoplognatha (Fig. 45B, C), an intermediate given its phylogenetic position (Fig. 102). In Carniella (Fig. 36I) both are unmodified. In Pholcomma the anterior one is very slightly flattened. These seem to represent secondary loss of spigot modification within pholcommatines, reaching its maximum in Carniella. Here flattened posterior AG spigots are an ambiguous synapomorphy of Theridiidae (ACCTRAN).

PLS aggregate gland form : (0) entire; (1) lobed. Apstein (1889) was probably the first to study silk glands in detail in a comparative framework. He studied a range of families, and pointed out that theridiids and Nesticus uniquely have lobed PLS AG glands. Kovoor (1977) and Kovoor & Lopez (1988) provided corroborating data (see also Nielsen, 1932; Coddington, 1986c, 1989; Forster et al., 1990; Griswold et al., 1998). Apstein (1889: 41, 60) found lobed aggregate glands in Theridion sisyphium, Enoplognatha ovata, Steatoda bipunctata, S. albomaculata, S. phalerata, Episinus truncatus, Crustulina guttata, Euryopis flavomaculata and Nesticus cellulanus, but not in Tetragnatha extensa or Linyphia triangularis. Here I code lobed PLS MAP glands as present in genera mentioned by Apstein (assumed if Apstein's study species is not in my matrix). Lobed glands also occur in Latrodectus mactans (Kovoor, 1977) and Steatoda grossa, Argyrodes argyrodes and A. elevatus (Kovoor & Lopez, 1983) Here the feature is optimized as synapomorphic for the theridioids (DELTRAN). Studying Synotaxus is important for accurate optimization of this feature. Interestingly, Apstein (1889: 61) briefly mentioned two lobed glands in Steatoda, Episinus, Crustulina, Euryopis and Nesticus, but only one in ‘Theridium ’ which included Enoplognatha and Theridion. Although too vague to be incorporated as a character here, the reduction to a single lobed PLS AG gland is at least a putative synapomorphy of clade 43.

PLS theridiid type AG position : (0) more or less parallel; (1) end-to-end. When the PLS AG spigots are flattened, their relative orientation becomes informative. In most theridiids they are organized ‘end-to-end’ (Figs 11B, 18F, 23A, 47C, 48F, 50A, B, 59E, 70B, 78B, 80A, 84B, 87D). In Latrodectinae and Pholcomminae (where applicable) the AG are not end-to-end but nearly parallel (Figs 43F, G, 45A–C, 55D, 63D, 72H, 74B, 82D). The orientation of the spigots can only be addressed when they are flat and thus this character is coded as inapplicable for taxa where both AGs are round, or only one of them is flattened.

PLS AG, FL (male) : (0) absent; (1) present. Adult male araneoids typically lack the triplet (AGs plus FL), and thus the ability to produce sticky silk (Figs 33D, 39G, 53A, 76G, 78D). Adult males of several araneoid lineages, however, retain these spigots such as cyatholipids (Griswold, 2001) and erigonine linyphiids (Cushing, 1995;,Hormiga, 2000). Male hadrotarsines (Figs 6F, 9C), argyrodines minus Argyrodes (Figs 48F, 65E), and a pholcommatine subclade (clade 38) (Figs 36I, 61D, E, 63D, 74I) also retain at least a part of the triplet (usually AGs, sometimes also FL). The triplet is scored as present if any of the triplet spigots are functional (e.g. female and male Dipoena lack the FL, but in both AGs are present).

PMS mAP nubbins : (0) present (Fig. 1F); (1) absent (Figs 14D, 16D, 23B, 25D). G98-71. PMS mAP spigot nubbins (Fig. 1F) are an araneoid synapomorphy (Coddington, 1990b; Griswold et al., 1998). The latter (character 71) mapped nubbin loss as a synapomorphy of the ‘araneoid sheet web weaver clade’, but regained in nesticids and Synotaxus. Here nubbin loss is, controversially, synapomorphic for linyphioids on one hand and theridiids on the other.

PMS CY spigot base : (0) distinct (Fig. 33C); (1) indistinct, absent (Fig. 1G).

PMS AC spigot number : (0) five or more; (1) four; (2) three; (3) two; (4) one; (5) none. G98-70, in part. Coddington (1989) and Griswold et al. (1998) hypothesized that a dense brush of AC spigots on the PMS was probably the primitive condition in Orbiculariae. Most derived araneoids, however, have exactly three AC spigots on the PMS. Coddington (1989) commented that the different numbers of PMS AC spigots in theridiids might be informative and this study supports that view. On this cladogram, exactly four PMS AC spigots defines Latrodectinae (Figs 43F, 55G, see also Coddington, 1989: fig. 28). Here, two PMS AC spigots are a theridiid synapomorphy (e.g. Figs 18G, 33C, 65D, 70C). Pholcomma has a single PMS AC spigot (Fig. 61D), while the related Carniella has none (Fig. 36I, also absent in Pimoa rupicola). Intraspecific variation in AC spigot numbers occurs in Pimoids (Hormiga, 1994a), but I did not record any in the theridiids I examined (left and right side were symmetrical in all specimens examined, males and females had equal numbers of AC spigots).

PMS minor ampullate (mAP) spigot shaft length : (0) short, subequal to CY shaft, or shorter (Fig. 7C); (1) clearly longer than any CY shaft. Long PMS mAP spigot shafts are here synapomorphic for clade 27 (Figs 18E–G, 23B, 25D, 27E, 87D), but the feature is quite homoplasious.

Prey-catching web : (0) present (Fig. 100A–F); (1) absent. Few hadrotarsines are known to build prey-catching webs (webs that trip or entangle prey). Dipoena tristis (see Wiehle, 1937) and D. torva (see Roberts, 1995) are exceptions. Supposedly, most are wandering ant specialists (e.g. Levi, 1954,1963;,Carico, 1978) Very little is known of theridiid webs in general. Although some are probably web-less, other studied theridiids do build prey-catching webs, or are able to do so (e.g. Nielsen, 1932; Whiele, 1937; Holm, 1939; Benjamin & Zschokke, 2003). Argyrodines in general do not build typical prey-catching webs (e.g. Eberhard, 1979;,Whitehouse, 1986, 1987b; Whitehouse & Jackson, 1993), but they do build silken structures into the structure of the webs of other spiders that catch prey. Some kleptoparasitic argyrodines facultatively build sticky traps that have been described as ‘inefficient’ (e.g. Whitehouse, 1986). Ariamnes builds non-sticky lures (Eberhard, 1979) in which a simple line web is used as substrate by other male spiders and nematocerous flies, which it then ambushes. Rhomphaea uses a similar ambush strategy, throwing sticky lines over approaching spiders (Whitehouse, 1987b).

Web form : (0) orb; (1) linyphioid-like knock-down sheet web (Fig. 99C); (2) chicken-wire, rectangular orb (Synotaxus, Fig. 95A); (3) cobweb (Figs 97G, 99A, B, 100A–F, 101A–E); (4) Spintharine H-web (Fig. 97A); (5) network mesh web, with foraging field below (e.g. A. rupununi); (6) dry line-web; (7) gumfoot line-web (Phoroncidia, Fig. 97B–D). G98-80. Objective coding of the wide variety of sheet and tangle web architecture remains problematic. Orb webs are well defined, both structurally and behaviourally (Robinson & Robinson, 1973, 1975; Eberhard, 1982, 1990; Coddington, 1986b; Hormiga et al., 1995). The Synotaxus chickenwire-like web (Fig. 95A) or ‘rectangular orb’ is likewise distinctive and constructed in well-defined behavioural units (Eberhard, 1977,,1995). Linyphioid sheet webs typically have a planar, horizontal sheet, sometimes sticky. Many, especially nonlitter dwelling linyphioids, have a mesh of nonsticky knock-down threads above the sheet intercepting prey in flight, which then gets trapped on the sheet (e.g. Benjamin et al., 2002). Some social Anelosimus webs are architecturally and functionally similar to linyphiid sheets, albeit typically dome-shaped (Fig. 99C). Cobweb is here considered to be a three-dimensional mesh, with or without gumfoot lines, whose catching area is not limited to a single plane (Figs 97G, 99A, B, 100A–F, 101A–E). Some have sticky silk in the mesh, while others have a central (Fig. 100A–F) or peripheral (Fig. 96C–F, and legend) retreat from which gumfoot lines radiate. In either case, the area where prey gets stuck is three-dimensional. A few theridiids apparently build cobwebs without sticky silk, while others do not build cobwebs, but rather linyphioid-like sheets. Spintharines typically build a highly modified H-shaped web with only two gumfoot lines (Fig. 97A, see also Holm, 1939; Ikeda et al., 1983; Roberts, 1995: 261), here not considered a ‘cobweb’, as it is planar. A few theridiids build ‘line-webs’, a few nonsticky lines that serve to lure rather than snare prey, e.g. Ariamnes (see Eberhard, 1979),Rhomphaea (see Whitehouse, 1987b), Thwaitesia spp. (pers. observ.). Phoroncidia makes a ‘gumfoot line-web’, a single gumfoot line (occasionally a few lines) that it holds on to (Fig. 97B–D, see also Eberhard, 1981). Some social theridiids build a mesh network without knockdown threads, but instead forage below the ‘sheet’ (Levi et al. 1982;,Lubin, 1982,,1995;,Avilés & Salazar, 1999).

Sticky silk in web : (0) present; (1) absent.

Sticky silk placement : (0) in sheet or tangle (Fig. 95A); (1) on gumfoot lines (Figs 96E, F, 97B–D, 101A, B, D). Araneoid webs typically contain viscous globules on silk lines of the sheet. Linyphia makes such sheets, but the sticky silk desiccates quickly and may not function as in orbs or gumfoots (Benjamin et al., 2002). In contrast, nesticids and many theridiids place the sticky globules on the tips of lines radiating from their mesh retreat or web centre, which attach to the substrate (gumfoot lines). In this cladogram the presence of gumfoot lines is a synapomorphy of theridioids, although repeatedly lost. Gumfoot line construction seems to constitute a unique, stereotyped behaviour (Benjamin & Zschokke, 2003). However, some theridiid web building behaviours are shared with other araneoids. For example, Achaearanea tepidariorum attaches sticky silk lines to dry lines in a manner typical of orb-weavers (Eberhard, 1982). Cutler (1972) found gumfoot lines in Coleosoma floridanum, but Benjamin & Zschokke (2003), indicate that the sticky silk is confined to the sheet. This discrepancy is here represented by coding C. floridanum as polymorphic for this character. [Note added in proof: Benjamin & Zschokke's observation was a lapsus (S. P. Benjamin, pers. comm.). C. floridanum has gumfoot lines.]

Wrap-bite attack : (0) present; (1) absent. G98-92. Some araneoid spiders wrap prey before biting, while others bite first (Robinson, 1975; Eberhard, 1982). The wrap-bite attack is apparently synapomorphic for orbicularians (Griswold et al., 1998) although lost in lineages such as linyphiids and pimoids. Here the attack is a synapomorphy of clade 57.

Sticky silk wrap attack : (0) absent; (1) present. G98-93. Theridiioids have a modified form of the wrap-bite attack in which sticky silk is employed (Whitehouse, 1987b; Forster et al., 1990; Griswold et al., 1998; Vakanas & Krafft, 2001). Nielsen (1932: 188) stated: ‘They [Theridium, including various theridiids] never attack their victim with the chelicerae before it is properly entangled in viscous threads. This is done by the spider turning its back to the victim and throwing threads over it by means of the tarsi of the posterior legs. The viscid matter may at first drip from these threads, which are subsequently more sparingly provided with it.’ Although presumed to be the rule for theridioids, relatively few observations have been published. Synotaxus is assumed to be similar (from a single observation on S. turbinatus; Griswold et al., 1998). Here the SS wrap attack is an ambiguous synapomorphy of the spineless femur clade (DELTRAN), because only Argiope wrap attacks do not involve SS, while Tetragnatha and linyphioids do not wrap attack at all.

Egg sac surface : (0) spherical to lenticular (Fig. 95B, C, E); (1) stalked (Figs 88E, 98D). Among theridiids, argyrodines are unusual in having a distinctly stalked egg sac that they usually hang on vegetation, or in webbing in their host's web (Fig. 98C, D).

Egg case structure : (0) suboval or roundish (Figs 95B, C, E, 101G); (1) basal knob (Fig. 98C, D); (2) rhomboid; (3) elongated (Fig. 98E); (4) Spiky. Exline & Levi (1962: figs 1–5) illustrate the types of egg sac found in the Argyrodines (see also Chikuni, 1989: 34–35), and these appear to be informative at the genus level. In addition to being stalked, Argyrodes, Faiditus and Neospintharus egg sacs have ‘basal’, cylindrical knobs (Fig. 98C, D); those of Rhomphaea are similar but rhomboid. Many Ariamnes egg sacs are thin and extremely elongated (Fig. 98E); others are like those of Rhomphaea. Latrodectus geometricus egg sacs are spiky.

Egg sac, outermost fibres : (0) fine, densely woven; (1) thick, coarsely spun. In at least some spintharines the outermost fibres of the egg sac are loosely woven, e.g. Thwaitesia (Fig. 88C) and Episinus, compared to many other theridiids where all fibres are densely spun and thus the egg sac surface appears smooth (Fig. 88A, E, G) (Roberts, 1995). There appear to be no observations for Spintharus.

Egg sac fibre ultrastructure : (0) smooth (Fig. 88A, B, E–H); (1) spiny (Fig. 88C, D). The egg sacs of spiders protect the eggs against predation and parasitism (Austin, 1985; Foelix, 1996). Presumably, most egg sac fibres are smooth (Fig. 88B, F, H), but Thwaitesia has unique spiny fibres in (at least) the outer layer of the sac (Fig. 88D). This morphology seems obviously defensive, although direct observation of their function is lacking. The character scoring is assumed for T. margaritifera based on Thwaitesia sp. from Madagascar, for Argyrodes argyrodes and A. elevatus based on Argyrodes sp., and for Theridion pictum and T. varians based on Theridion sp. Although data remain very sparse, the feature is included here to emphasize this fascinating feature of Thwaitesia, and to stimulate further work on egg case ultrastructure.

Web construction : (0) solitary; (1) communal. The participation of several individuals (whether juvenile or adult) in web construction is one of the features that define web-sharing sociality.

Sex ratio : (0) roughly equal <2 × female-biased; (1) >3 × female-biased. Social theridiids characteristically have female-biased sex ratios, unlike the vast majority of spiders (e.g. Avilés & Maddison, 1991; Avilés et al., 2000). Unbiased sex ratios can be inferred from museum collections and are here presumed in the absence of contrary evidence. Sex ratio bias seems to increase with the level of sociality. Interestingly, Stiles & Coyle (2001) reported slightly biased sex ratios in Theridion frondeum and two Rugathodes species (about 1.9 females per male). At least two of these show maternal care beyond the egg sac stage, and such slight sex ratio biases may well be common in species showing extensive maternal care.

Male palp amputation : (0) both palps present before (and after) final moult; (1) one palp amputated prior to final moult. Tidarren and Echinotheridion males amputate one palp (left or right randomly) prior to the final moult so that the adult has only a single functional palp (Branch, 1942; Knoflach & van-Harten, 2000,,2001;,Knoflach, 2002). Only Tidarren is included in this study, but future inclusion of Echinotheridion will demonstrate if this remarkable behaviour in the two genera is homologous.

Initial palpal insertions : (0) transfer sperm; (1) pseudocopulation. In Linyphia and some distal theridiines, the first palpal insertion is a pseudocopulation, not involving sperm transfer (Helsdingen, 1983;,Knoflach, 1998)

Palpal insertions : (0) ipsilateral; (1) contralateral. During mating the male spider may insert its palp either to a corresponding epigynal opening (ipsilateral) or to the opposite one (contralateral). Presumably, ipsilateral insertions are the norm in orbiculariarian spiders (Gerhard, 1921−33;,Helversen, 1976;,Huber & Senglet, 1997; Knoflach, 1998).,Huber (1993) found ipsilateral insertions in Nesticus cellulanus (assumed here for N. silvestrii), and Gerhardt for many basal theridiids. However, Tetragnatha spp. (e.g. T. extensa) and Leucauge use contralateral insertions (Huber & Senglet, 1997), as do Theridion varians, T. pictum, and Coleosoma floridanum (Knoflach, 1998).,Tidarren cuneolatum, which has only one palp, uses ipsilateral insertions only when mating with a previously mated female plugged on the contralateral side (Knoflach & van-Harten, 2000).

Sperm induction : (0) independent of copulation; (1) during copulation sequence. Male spiders typically charge their palps with sperm prior to entering the female web, while in others sperm induction is a part of the copulation sequence (e.g. Gerhardt, 1921−33). Data for Tetragnatha extensa, Linyphia triangularis, Nesticus cellulanus, Steatoda (4 species) and Enoplognatha ovata are from Gerhardt (1921−33, as summarized by Huber, 1998). Data for Dipoena, Euryopis, Latrodectus, Achaearanea tepidariorum, Tidarren sisyphoides, Kochiura aulica are from Knoflach (1998) and Knoflach & van-Harten (2000). Here, induction by Nesticus silvestrii is assumed, based on N. cellulanus, by Steatoda grossa, based on Gerhard's four Steatoda species, by Dipoena, Euryopis and Latrodectus, based on congeners observed. The logical interdependence (if any) of this character and character 237 is not clear.

Mating thread : (0) present; (1) absent. In some theridiids, as in many other araneoids, the male constructs a special thread in the female web on which mating takes place (e.g. Gerhardt, 1921−33; Knoflach, 1998). In others, mating takes place on threads of the female web.

Bulbal movements during insertion : (0) no rhythmic movements; (1) rhythmic expansion of haematodocha.

Male position during deposition of sperm on sperm web : (0) below; (1) above.
